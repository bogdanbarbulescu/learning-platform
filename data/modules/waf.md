
## What is a Web Application Firewall (WAF)?

A **Web Application Firewall (WAF)** is a security device designed to protect organizations at the application level by filtering, monitoring and analyzing hypertext transfer protocol (HTTP) and hypertext transfer protocol secure (HTTPS) traffic between the web application and the internet.

A WAF acts as a **reverse proxy**, shielding the application from malicious requests before they reach the user or web application. Part of a comprehensive cybersecurity strategy, a WAF helps protect the organization from a variety of **application layer attacks**, including Cross Site Scripting (XSS), SQL injection, Zero Day attacks, and Denial of Service (DoS)/Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks.


WAFs can be deployed as:
- network-based
- host-based
- cloud-based solutions, providing visibility into application data at the **HTTP** application layer.

Web application firewalls are designed to counter common web exploits like **malicious bot**s. WAFs safeguard against threats that compromise availability, security, or resources including zero-day exploits, bots, and malware.

## How does a WAF work?

A WAF works by inspecting HTTP requests and applying predefined rules to identify malicious traffic. It can be software, an appliance, or a service. The WAF analyzes the following key parts of HTTP conversations:

- **GET requests**: These requests retrieve data from the server.
- **POST request**s: These requests send data to the server to change its state.
- **PUT requests**: These requests send data to the server to update or create.
- **DELETE requests**: These are requests to delete data.

The WAF also analyzes the headers, query strings, and body of HTTP requests for malicious patterns. If the WAF finds a match, it will block the request and send an alert to the security team.


## Why is WAF security important?

Integrating a WAF with other security tools like [Cisco Duo 2FA](https://duo.com/) and [Cisco malware protection](https://www.cisco.com/site/us/en/products/security/endpoint-security/secure-endpoint/index.html) creates a robust defense strategy.

### How does WAF contribute to web app security?

Many applications today are created using a combination of home-grown, third-party, and open-source code. WAFs add an extra layer of security to inadequately built or legacy applications and help to enhance secure design practices by blocking common attack vectors and preventing malicious traffic from reaching the application. Below is a list of significant advantages specific to WAFs.

- WAFs can block malicious traffic before it reaches a web application, preventing data breaches and other attacks.
- WAFs can help to protect sensitive data, such as credit card numbers and customer Personally Identifiable Information (PII), from unauthorized access.
- WAFs can help to meet compliance requirements, such as PCI DSS, by blocking traffic that violates those requirements.
- WAFs can work in conjunction with other security tools, such as an intrusion detection system (IDS), intrusion prevention system (IPS), and firewalls, to create a layered defense that is more effective at preventing attacks.


### On-premises

This is the traditional deployment option, where the WAF virtual or hardware appliance is installed on site at the organization's data center. Suitable for organizations requiring flexibility, high performance, and advanced security.


## F5 Advanced WAF

**Best choice for advanced security capabilities.**

[F5 Advanced WAF](https://www.f5.com/pt_br/products/security/advanced-waf) (previously known as F5 BIG-IP Application Security Manager) is a WAF product that secures online applications by combining traffic filtering, proactive bot protection, application-layer encryption, and [behavioral analytics](https://www.esecurityplanet.com/products/best-user-and-entity-behavior-analytics-ueba-tools/). F5 Advanced WAF is built on proven F5 technology and goes beyond reactive security features like static signatures and reputation to identify and neutralize bots, safeguard passwords and sensitive data, and fight against application denial-of-service (DoS). F5 Advanced WAF is a good choice for organizations with sophisticated web-based apps that require advanced security capabilities like automated threat detection and API protection.

### Key Features
