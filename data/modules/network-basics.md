# TCP/IP Protocol Suite

## Overview
The **TCP/IP Protocol Suite** is the foundation of modern networking, enabling communication between devices over the Internet and private networks. It consists of multiple layers, each responsible for specific functions.

## TCP/IP Model Layers
The TCP/IP model consists of **four layers**, which map roughly to the seven-layer OSI model:

1. **Network Interface Layer (Link Layer)**
   - Handles physical transmission of data.
   - Interfaces with network hardware (e.g., Ethernet, Wi-Fi).
   - Protocols: Ethernet, ARP, PPP.

2. **Internet Layer**
   - Responsible for logical addressing and routing.
   - Enables data packets to traverse different networks.
   - Protocols: IP (IPv4, IPv6), ICMP, IGMP.

3. **Transport Layer**
   - Provides end-to-end communication.
   - Ensures data integrity and reliable transmission.
   - Protocols: TCP (connection-oriented), UDP (connectionless).

4. **Application Layer**
   - Supports user-facing applications and services.
   - Protocols: HTTP, FTP, DNS, SMTP, SSH.

## Addressing in TCP/IP
- **IP Addressing**: Unique identifier for devices on a network (e.g., 192.168.1.1).
- **MAC Addressing**: Physical address assigned to network interfaces.
- **Subnetting**: Divides a larger network into smaller sub-networks.
- **DNS (Domain Name System)**: Resolves human-readable domain names to IP addresses.

## Network Basics
### 1. **What is a Network?**
A network is a collection of connected devices that communicate and share resources.

### 2. **Types of Networks**
- **LAN (Local Area Network)**: Small, localized network (e.g., home, office).
- **WAN (Wide Area Network)**: Large, distributed network (e.g., the Internet).
- **MAN (Metropolitan Area Network)**: City-wide network.
- **PAN (Personal Area Network)**: Short-range network (e.g., Bluetooth).

### 3. **Networking Devices**
- **Router**: Directs traffic between networks.
- **Switch**: Connects multiple devices within a network.
- **Hub**: Basic device that forwards data to all connected devices.
- **Firewall**: Security device that filters network traffic.

### 4. **Common Network Protocols**
- **HTTP/HTTPS**: Web communication.
- **FTP/SFTP**: File transfer.
- **DNS**: Domain name resolution.
- **DHCP**: Dynamic IP address assignment.

## Conclusion
The **TCP/IP protocol suite** is essential for modern networking, providing structured communication between devices across various networks. Understanding its layers, addressing mechanisms, and basic network components is crucial for network engineers and IT professionals.
