# Communicating Security Topics

In this article, you will learn about communicating with stakeholders regarding cybersecurity topics.

## What we’ll be learning

Communicating and discussing cybersecurity topics can be a challenge for many [Information Technology (IT)](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/blog/what-is-information-technology/) professionals. You often find that stakeholders lack familiarity with the current threat landscape or the technical understanding needed to have valuable conversations regarding security. However, as cybersecurity threats increases, it is more critical than ever to have simple, informed, and proactive cybersecurity dialogues.

In this article, we will be learning how to communicate to stakeholders, specifically non-technical stakeholders, regarding security-related topics.

## Importance of communicating security topics

In the IT industry, it is a well-known fact that many business stakeholders and some IT professionals consider security to be a blocker and a hindrance. This well-known fact is due because security requirements and risk assessments can often be quite rigorous. Due to this perception in the industry, communicating to businesses about cybersecurity can be a challenge for many security professionals and teams. That said, as cybersecurity professionals, it becomes our responsibility to ensure that communication is handled concisely and digestible for our stakeholders.

The rise in cyberattacks and data breaches requires organizations to design comprehensive and dynamic approaches to protect their organizations and their assets. So far, the best way to ensure the protection of organizations and their assets is to inform, motivate, and prioritize security measures.

The support of high-level executives such as the CEO, CTO, and CISO of a company is a great start in developing the company’s security awareness. By building awareness, effective communication of security concerns in project development will move forward efficiently. Cybersecurity professionals should be able to communicate security topics across the different levels of the business.

## Types of stakeholders

There are different types of stakeholders. But, before we discuss the different types, let us understand what and who is a stakeholder. A stakeholder is considered any person or group involved in the project for any reason. It can be someone who may affect, be affected by, or perceive themselves affected by your project or program. It is imperative that security teams understand, identify and categorize their stakeholders. Projects can organize stakeholders into two main categories, Internal and External Stakeholders.

### Internal stakeholders

Internal stakeholders are stakeholders that are within the organization. Some of these stakeholders can be:

-   **Project sponsor** - Typically, the person or group that has the authority to request a project and provide funding to the project.
    
    Example: _If your security organization had a new technology that they wanted to implement, like a SIEM (Security Information and Event Management), they would need a project sponsor to approve and provide funding for the project._
    
-   **Executive leadership** - Typically, anyone in the upper management team or C-Suite executives, usually your CEO, CTO, CISO, or Director.
    
    Example: _Keeping with the new request for implementing a new SIEM in your security organization, you would need to present a business justification case to the executive leadership group as to why the SIEM is required, what value it will add to the company, and its cost-benefit analysis._
    
-   **End users** - The internal teams that will also use the product components after completion.
    
    Example: _Departments within your organization’s security team that might benefit from the output logs from the SIEM._
    
-   **Partner Teams** - Internal teams outside your direct organization interested in the project’s outcome.
    
    _Example: Another IT department within your company outside of the security team, like the Event Management team. This IT team might benefit from using the SIEM implemented by the Security Department._
    

### External stakeholders

External stakeholders are stakeholders that are outside the organization. Some of these stakeholders can be:

-   **Clients or customers** - These are companies or people that will be consumers of the end product or project.
    
    _Example: The external customers’ data that the SIEM technology is for, might be configured to capture and log._
    
-   **Vendors** - These are the customers sourcing the technology and services needed for the product.
    
    _Example: The vendor you would use to procure the SIEM technology for your security department._
    
-   **Competitors or opponents** - Companies that offer the same or similar products or services.
    

## What’s important to stakeholders

The importance of stakeholder groups, and the strategy you take to engage them, will depend on the outcomes needed and the available resources. To capitalize on stakeholder engagement, you need to understand what is important to your stakeholders.

-   **Cost-Benefit**: When proposing a new security technology or control for security, cybersecurity professionals will need to effectively communicate the cost of implementation and compare the derived or future benefits for the business.
    
-   **Time**: Projects cannot go on indefinitely. Stakeholders will need to know the proposed timelines for implementing new security projects and controls. Creating a project plan and having deadlines and milestones documented is essential.
    
-   **Resources**: Some Stakeholder groups will also need to know how many resources are required for your security efforts. In some cases, security teams will need to reallocate resources based on the level of effort or priority for a security effort to the department or business.
    
-   **Associated Risk** - Stakeholders will also need to know and understand the associated risks with your security proposal or controls. As cybersecurity professionals, you will need to understand a risk register and how this falls into your proposal for your stakeholders. Learn more about [Risk Registers](https://www.cybersaint.io/blog/risk-register-examples-for-cybersecurity).
    

## How to communicate security topics

Today, cybersecurity professionals are asked to report and proactively assess the environment and anticipate new risks. Cybersecurity professionals contribute and understand the ecosystem of both the business and IT departments to help better their organizations, protect vital operations, and take advantage of strategic opportunities. Below we will outline four key steps to help cybersecurity professionals start those conversations.

### Communicate using non-technical jargon

Having conversations and getting business support is easier when speaking the same language.

A considerable part of creating and having a risk-aware organization is based on a language that everyone understands. Communicating without technical jargon and using language that everyone understands helps your organization build a shared perspective on cybersecurity and other risks. As a result, the business can make effective decisions and investments.

Usually, when discussing vulnerabilities, threats, security risks, technical terms, and data, it can confuse a non-technical person or an executive leader who is not in the weeds daily. It is crucial to find reporting metrics that speak a language everyone can understand and use tools that can help you communicate.

### Lead with the risk

The best cybersecurity professionals have a holistic understanding of the overall business strategy and goals. These professionals know how these goals intersect with security and how cyber risk could potentially impact those goals. It is important to emphasize to stakeholders why proactive security measures and controls are essential and how the business is at risk if you do not implement them. In your communication, make sure to include a cost-benefit analysis for any recommendations for new security projects or implementations. Stakeholders might need frequent reminders that a proactive approach to cybersecurity is less costly to the company when compared to potential costs of breaches, both financially and to the company’s reputation. Good business and effective cybersecurity go hand in hand. Reiterate your awareness that IT and security systems should work cohesively with other parts of the business and not hinder progress.

### Speak to what is relevant

When discussing security, IT professionals should be aware of their audience. Some stakeholders, like the C-Suite executives, may want a high-level report. In contrast, others may demand a more detailed technical report. Whether reporting to C-suite executives or other stakeholders groups, adapt your presentation and add appropriate context for the audience to take action.

### Simplify your security conversations

Creating a culture of security awareness requires commitment and intention from your company’s top executives and managers. Maintaining a robust security posture requires company leaders to commit to security and be willing to support security initiatives. To start, try creating an environment where sharing information about security and having productive conversations about these topics become the norm in your organization.

## Conclusion

In this article, we reviewed the importance of communicating security topics. As you continue to progress as a cybersecurity professional, it is paramount that you have and lead discussions around cybersecurity topics with various stakeholder groups.


# Threats, Risks, Vulnerabilities, and Exploits

As a Cybersecurity Analyst, it’s important to know the difference between threats, risks, vulnerabilities, and exploits.

## What We’ll Be Learning

Cybersecurity practitioners are expected to demonstrate a security-focused mindset that incorporates conceptual security practices, as well as an understanding of security technologies. In preparation for the cybersecurity analyst interview, it is important to understand fundamental Cybersecurity concepts and terminology. The following list of learning outcomes may be achieved after completing this section:

-   Clearly identify and define threats, risks, vulnerabilities, and exploits

## Threats, Risks, & Vulnerabilities

Cybersecurity Analysts must be skilled at discovering where vulnerabilities hide, which threats require prioritization, and which risks to eliminate or accept. Yet, we may ask: what exactly are vulnerabilities, threats, and risks anyway?! Understanding each of these terms is important in the cybersecurity mindset. To begin, we must learn the definition of each term.

**Threat**: An _event_ or _condition_ that may negatively affect computing assets, individuals, or data and information through loss, exposure, damage, or destruction.

**Risk**: The _probability_ of loss, exposure, damage, or destruction to computing assets, individuals, or data and information.

**Vulnerability**: A _weakness_ in computing assets, information systems, and network infrastructure that could be exploited by a threat.

### Scenario: Threats, Risks, and Vulnerabilities

Mobile phones have many methods of securing contents through various screen locking features. A user may enter a password, a Personal Identification Number (PIN), biometrics, or other types of authentication. Users enable authentication mechanisms to secure their data and information (i.e. images, documents, emails, etc.) and applications from anyone who does not have permission to access it. Yet, there are many users who DO NOT secure their phones with a screen locking feature.

In this scenario of mobile device security, we will see all three concepts identified:

Ryan recently bought a new iPhone and transferred all of his data and applications from his previous phone to his new phone, which is the newer version of his old mobile phone. Ryan is known to use his phone for personal and business purposes. Since Ryan is a part-time Certified Public Accountant (CPA) much of his clients banking, investments, and tax information are on his mobile device in the form of documents and in emails. Ryan has failed to set a lock screen feature on his new phone.

In this scenario, the threat, risk, and vulnerability may be identified as:

**Threat:** An _event_ in which any person accesses the data, information, and applications on the mobile phone without consent and permission of the owner of the phone.

**Vulnerability:** The lock screen feature is not enabled on the phone; therefore the phone is always unlocked/open. This is a _weakness_ in Ryan’s system.

**Risk:** The _probability_ of someone accessing the contents of the phone may be highly likely depending on the amount of exposure the phone has to other people, the mobility of the phone, and the fact it is easily concealed if stolen.

## Practice Scenario

Read the following scenario and choose the answers that best answer the questions.

> Apple, the IOS software development company, has recently been alerted that the latest IOS source code has been posted to a publicly accessible GitHub repository. The company immediately addresses the code leak by enacting the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, or DMCA, to help take down the IOS source code from the GitHub repository. An investigation of the cause of the leak revealed that the source code was uploaded to GitHub by an Apple intern who thought it would be worth sharing with colleagues on an IOS Jailbreaking community page.

_This is based on a real event. Learn more about it in the Resources section at the end of this article._


## Exploits

An **exploit** is any _program_, _code_, or _action_ designed to locate and _take advantage of a vulnerability_ in software, networks, or computer systems with malicious intent and purpose.

**Exploits are crafted to target vulnerabilities.**

Exploits in computing typically target security vulnerabilities in software. These vulnerabilities can be bugs or gaps in the security posture of an organization’s system architecture or security settings. An exploit is only successful when an attack sequence is initiated by an attacker. In fact, software developers continuously work to identify bugs that may be present in their software in order to patch security vulnerabilities. These types of corrections are delivered to the end-user in the form of software updates. For this reason, it is a good practice to regularly update the software you use.

### Scenario Continued: Exploits

In the first part of this scenario, the mobile phone was not secured by a password, PIN, or biometric lock screen mechanism. Since then, Ryan has updated his security practices, and his phone now asks the user for a PIN in order to unlock the screen. Yet, we observe a shift in vulnerability when an exploit is introduced to the scenario:

In December, Ryan enabled the screen locking features of his phone after attending a “cyber awareness” training hosted by his employer and learning the importance of securing the contents of his smartphone. One month later, an iPhone lock screen **vulnerability** was discovered in the Apple iOS version installed on Ryan’s device. To **exploit the vulnerability**, an attacker could bypass a phone’s lock screen by simply calling the voice-activated smart assistant to access the contact list. The bypass also gave the user the ability to launch conferencing applications like video chat even though the phone was locked. For a CPA like Ryan, the unauthorized disclosure of their contact list could negatively affect their clients and the CPA’s overall business.

Apple immediately releases a security update to patch the flaw in the lock screen technology, but Ryan _does not install the update_! Three months later, Ryan leaves his smartphone unsupervised in the lobby of a hotel hosting a CPA convention. A rival CPA noticed the unsupervised device and was able to bypass the lock screen to collect the names and numbers of many of Ryan’s clients.

In the scenario, to exploit the vulnerability, which was the lock screen bug, a user could simply use the voice-activated assistant to gain access to information stored on the device. The exploit was the _action_ of using Siri to take advantage of the bug in the device’s lock screen technology and bypass the lock screen.

![An image showing that a bug allowing the lock screen to be bypassed on a phone makes that phone at a high risk of being attacked. Fixing the bug changes the situation to a low-risk situation.](https://static-assets.codecademy.com/Paths/cybersecurity-analyst-career-path/cybersecurity-analyst-interview-prep/general-knowledge/key-definitions/Vulnerabilities%202.svg)

## Conclusion

The cybersecurity mindset incorporates a plethora of principles, frameworks, and security practices built upon fundamental security concepts. When applying for an analyst role, it is expected that analysts embody the cybersecurity mindset. To prepare for the analyst role interview, it is a good idea to fortify foundational key security definitions prior to an interview.

A cybersecurity analyst must be able to clearly define and identify a threat, risk, vulnerability, and exploit. Each of the concepts covered in this article is essential for the success of the cybersecurity analyst.

# CIA Triad

When looking at security vulnerabilities, it’s important to understand the CIA Triad.

## What we’ll be learning

Cybersecurity practitioners are expected to demonstrate a security-focused mindset that incorporates conceptual security practices, as well as an understanding of security technologies. It is important to understand fundamental Cybersecurity concepts and terminology. In this article, we’ll learn:

-   Understand The CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability)
-   Incorporate the concept into your Cybersecurity mindset

## The CIA triad

Cybersecurity practitioners are expected to be familiar with fundamental security management principles and concepts. The **CIA Triad** simplifies the primary goals and objectives of Cybersecurity for policy writers, system architects, and security practitioners. The CIA Triad, and its principles, define the overall goals and objectives of security implementations and practices in Cybersecurity. Using the CIA Triad as guidelines for anything Cybersecurity-related is a good practice.

The CIA Triad contains the three primary principles in Cybersecurity:

-   **Confidentiality**
-   **Integrity**
-   **Availability**

![A triangular diagram shows the three corners Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability, with Data in the center of the triad.](https://static-assets.codecademy.com/Paths/cybersecurity-analyst-career-path/cybersecurity-analyst-interview-prep/general-knowledge/key-definitions/Cybersecurity_CIA_Diagram_1-06.svg)

The CIA Triad is used to evaluate the risks and vulnerabilities of an organization based on the threat these may pose to any of the three principles. Organizations should ensure the three principles captured in the CIA Triad are addressed in their Cybersecurity governance, practice, and in technical implementations.

### Confidentiality

_Definition_: Preserving safeguards, access controls, and disclosures of sensitive data to ensure privacy (aka confidentiality) of personal and proprietary information from unintended parties.

_Simplified Concept_: Only authorized individuals, processes, and systems that should have access to information can access it.

A tenet of Cybersecurity and information security is the achievement of the complete confidentiality of data. For confidentiality to be successful, the data and information must be secured from unauthorized disclosure, access, or use while:

-   **In storage** (_Think: data-at-rest_):
    
    Information stored in _any_ form of storage must remain secured and confidential. This includes local hard disk drives (HDD), solid-state disks (SSD), flash drives (USB thumb drives, SD cards, etc.), compact disks (CD, Blu-Ray, etc.), floppy disks (rare, but to note), and in the cloud.
    
-   **In process** (_Think: system processes active in CPU and RAM_):
    
    This includes any information being actively processed by a processing unit or placed in volatile memory (RAM, buffers, and cache memory). The data stored in the process is susceptible to theft from malware or buffer overflow attacks on a computing device, therefore it must be ensured that this data and information remains confidential.
    
-   **Traversing a network** (_Think: in transit_):
    
    Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure, or HTTPS, protocol uses encryption to maintain the confidentiality of data traveling from one network to another. Remove the “S” from “HTTPS” and you get “HTTP”. The communication established with HTTP travels between networks in _plaintext_. The encryption applied by HTTPS guards data and information against unauthorized prying eyes, maintaining the confidentiality of the communications. Confidentiality must be maintained while data travels across networks!
    

To protect information from unauthorized disclosure, access, or theft, access control methodologies are applied to an organization’s information security practices. One key concept is the **principle of least privilege**. The principle of least privilege states that access to data/information should be restricted to ONLY the resources absolutely necessary to perform a job function. In other words, users, accounts, and computing processes should only have the minimum authorized permissions necessary to perform routines and authorized job roles.

**Encryption** is a key technology that contributes to securing data and information from unauthorized access. Encryption techniques such as file/disk encryption and encrypted communications are effective in maintaining the confidentiality of data and information.

### Integrity

_Definition_: Guarding data/information, in transit or at rest, from unauthorized destruction or modification so that it remains in the state intended by the owner(s) upon receipt or submission. Ensuring the data/information is authentic and proven to be received from the true origin of the data/information (non-repudiation).

_Simplified Concept_: Data is what we expect it to be.

In computing, the integrity of data/information means ensuring data is authentic, accurate, and is free from unauthorized modification. In information security, if a security mechanism ensures integrity, then we can be sure that data/information is unaltered and in its original state. Similar to confidentiality, integrity must be ensured at rest, in process, and in transit.

One of the most basic methods for confirming the integrity of digital assets is cryptographic **hashing**. In hashing, data is processed through a hash function which produces a unique hash value. That hash value is now similar to a “certificate of authenticity” since the data will _always_ produce the same hash value if processed through the same hash function.

![A diagram showing that encryption uses keys to encrypt and decrypt data while hashing results in data being transformed into a hash.](https://static-assets.codecademy.com/Paths/cybersecurity-analyst-career-path/cybersecurity-analyst-interview-prep/general-knowledge/key-definitions/Cybersecurity_HashingvsEncryption_v2-08.svg)

Integrity is also vital in ensuring the authenticity of data origins. A concept known as **non-repudiation** is a combination of authenticity and integrity. It ensures that we know who authored transmitted communications and data, and that this user or entity can’t deny they did the action.

### Availability

_Definition_: Ensuring that access to information, and the networked services that host the information, are accessible in a reliable and timely manner by users at all times.

_Simplified Concept_: Data is available when it should be.

Perhaps the simplest concept of the CIA Triad is the tenet of availability. **Availability** means that information of an individual or organization must be accessible to them when they need it. Denying access to data and information is a common security threat in Cybersecurity, therefore Cybersecurity practitioners must incorporate availability into the Cybersecurity mindset. For example, Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks are designed to overwhelm or crash networked or local services so that data and information are inaccessible. While external DoS attacks are a real threat, loss of availability is often caused by accidental hardware failures, software bugs/errors, or environmental concerns. In our Cybersecurity mindset, we should be able to implement infrastructure safeguards and be able to identify possible obstructions of data availability.

Availability is mandatory for networked resources such as databases, web applications, websites, etc. When it comes to networked services, performance, redundancy, backups, and data loss prevention are essential in ensuring availability.


## Conclusion

The Cybersecurity mindset incorporates a plethora of principles, frameworks, and security practices built upon fundamental security concepts. When applying for an analyst role, it is expected that analysts embody the Cybersecurity mindset. To prepare for the analyst role interview, it is a good idea to fortify foundational key security definitions prior to an interview.

Decisions made should be made with consideration of the three tenets of the CIA Triad. Each of the concepts covered in this article is essential for the success of a Cybersecurity professional.

# Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting (AAA)

As a Cybersecurity Analyst, it’s important to understand Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting (AAA).

## What We’ll Be Learning

Cybersecurity practitioners are expected to demonstrate a security-focused mindset that incorporates conceptual security practices, as well as an understanding of security technologies. In preparation for the cybersecurity analyst interview, it is important to understand fundamental Cybersecurity concepts and terminology. The following list of learning outcomes may be achieved after completing this section:

-   Explain the difference between Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting (AAA)
-   Understand the purpose of the AAA framework

## Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting (AAA)

Security frameworks are common in cybersecurity. They are used to make understanding and memorization of structured security concepts easier. One fundamental security framework focuses on controlling access to computer systems, enforcement of policies, and auditing practices in all computing actions in a computer system. The framework is known as AAA.

### Authentication

**Definition**: Verifying the identity of a user, account, process, computer device before granting access to data, information, or computing resource.

**Simplified Concept**: Check the identity of a user before allowing them system access. In other words, “who you are”.

One of the most important concepts in cybersecurity, authentication plays a crucial role in access control to data. Authentication, paired with identification, proves someone is who they claim to be and may be granted access because they have the access keys. There are three primary authentication factors used in computer security, and they are often used together to authenticate users:

-   **Something you know**:
    
    Also known as the **knowledge** factor, this authentication factor requires the entity requesting access to _know_ something that proves they are who they say they are and should have access to. Some of the most common examples of **something you know** are username/passwords, PINs, and combination/patterns.
    
-   **Something you have**:
    
    Also known as the **possession** factor, this authentication factor requires the entity requesting access to have, or **possess** something that proves they are who they say they are. Having something that is unique to the authorized user proves you are that user. A few **something you have** examples are Smartcards (with chips), Proximity Cards, Rotating PIN Tokens, or smartphones with registered phone number.
    
-   **Something you are**:
    
    Also known as the **inherence** factor, this authentication factor requires the entity requesting access to be, or have something **inherent** about them, that proves they are who they say they are. Being something proves that someone is who they say they are! Fingerprints are unique to each human being, as is the retina or voice signature. When physical characteristics are used to recognize an individual for security purposes, this technique is called biometrics. Many modern authentication technologies allow biometrics to be used for **something you are** authentication factors.
    

![A visual representation of the three factors of authentication: There is a code above "Something You Know", a credit card above "Something You Have", and an eye above "Something You Are"](https://static-assets.codecademy.com/Paths/cybersecurity-analyst-career-path/cybersecurity-analyst-interview-prep/general-knowledge/key-definitions/ThreeFactorsofAuthenticationDiagram-v2.svg)

To properly perform authentication, at least two of the primary three factors must be present at the time of authentication. For example, possessing a smartcard and knowing the correct PIN associated with the smartcard is valid authentication. The more factors incorporated in authentication, the stronger it is, and this is why multi-factor authentication (MFA) is preferred over single-factor authentication.

Some additional authentication factors that have been incorporated into cybersecurity are **something you act** and **somewhere you are**. It may be beneficial to have awareness of these factors.

-   **Something you act**:
    
    This authentication factor requires the entity requesting access to act in a way that proves they are who they say they are. This could be an authentication sequence where a specific sequence of actions must be accurately performed to grant the user access.
    
-   **Somewhere you are**:
    
    This authentication factor requires the entity requesting access to be in a location that proves they are who they say they are and may have access due to proximity to the authorized location. To increase security during authentication, the general location may be an incorporated factor. For example, if the user requesting access should be in the state of Florida, it would be suspicious for the user to suddenly be logging in from Australia.
    

### Authorization

**Definition**: The rights, privileges, or permissions of any user, account, program, process, or computing device, granted access to a computing system or the resources and data hosted within.

**Simplified Concept**: Checking the permission granted to the user logged in, and giving only that level of permission. In other words, “what you can access”.

Authorization simply defines what you are allowed to do. Let’s use the example of a company laptop. The laptop is managed by the security policies set by company cybersecurity professionals. The organization has different computer roles: basic user, manager, and administrator. Each computer role has different permissions and privileges which are assigned by the policy associated with each role. For example:

-   User: Has access to use installed productivity applications and permission to create/modify/delete files owned by the user.
-   Manager: Has access to use installed productivity applications and permission to create/modify/delete files owned by the manager. The manager also has the privilege to modify/delete files owned by users.
-   Administrator: Full access to anything on the company laptop, to include: create/delete user accounts, install/uninstall applications, change OS settings, and more.

In this example, each role is only allowed to do certain things. The more elevated the privilege of the role, the more that the user is allowed to do and access a system.

### Accounting

**Definition**: Recording and auditing all actions performed in a system by a user, account, process, program, or computing device in order to promote accountability.

**Simplified Concept**: Enforce accountability by recording all actions performed within a system.

A requirement of the AAA framework is accounting. The concept of accounting is simple; record all actions performed in a computer system or network. The information recorded includes usernames, time of action, date of action, description of the action, the result of an action, etc. The more detail gathered about the actions, the better the accounting.

The purpose of accounting is to have logs that may be audited in the event of irregular behavior or critical system events. It is also necessary to track that all actions are authorized and to identify any suggestions of unauthorized activities. Each action or event may be attributed to a specific entity in a system, therefore accountability may be enforced and leveraged in investigation and legal outcomes.


## Conclusion

The cybersecurity mindset incorporates a plethora of principles, frameworks, and security practices built upon fundamental security concepts. When applying for an analyst role, it is expected that analysts embody the cybersecurity mindset. To prepare for the analyst role interview, it is a good idea to fortify foundational key security definitions prior to an interview.

When the analysis is being performed of system logs, the AAA framework will guide the outcomes of the analysis performed. Each of the concepts covered in this article is essential for the success of the cybersecurity analyst.


# Basics of Networking for Cybersecurity Analysts

In this article, you’ll review fundamental computer networking knowledge essential in preparing for the Cybersecurity Analyst role.

## What We’ll Be Learning

Computer networks are everywhere. Most technology today leverages the _internet_, the largest network, or a smaller type of network. Cybersecurity Analysts should be well versed in basic networking. In fact, a main function of the Cybersecurity Analyst role is **the analysis and inspection of network traffic** both from an operational security perspective and a highly technical perspective. Understanding the fundamentals of computer networking is a critical skill to add to our Cybersecurity Mindset. This article reviews a plethora of important networking knowledge that a Cybersecurity Analyst must know.

The following list of learning outcomes may be achieved after completing the section:

-   Explain and identify computer networks and the different types of networks.
-   Understand the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) Model.
-   Explain the role of each layer of the OSI Model.
-   Explain the difference between the OSI and TCP/IP (Transmission Control and Internet Protocols) Models.
-   Explain how computer communication happens on a network.
-   Explain the difference between PDUs (protocol data units).
-   Understand communication protocols.
-   Understand the Bluetooth Protocol Stack.
-   Clearly identify network defense and security solutions.

## Networking

What happens when we access Codecademy? How are we able to access the content provided by this course? Networking!

Your device uses a network connection and goes through a series of defined network protocols to send and receive information.

![A person connects to Codecademy. The laptop is connected by a road to the router, and the router gives access to the Internet, depicted as a shiny globe.](https://static-assets.codecademy.com/Paths/cybersecurity-analyst-career-path/cybersecurity-analyst-interview-prep/general-knowledge/networking/network-art.svg)

A **network** is two or more computers or devices that are linked in order to share information. Our computers and devices are able to communicate due to a large set of standards, much like we have road systems and traffic protocols when we drive a car. These network standards have been built by the community over the decades, and these standards guide engineers and security professionals.

### Types of Networks

There are a number of network types an analyst should be familiar with. A **network type** is defined by _the characteristics of the network_ such as network size and network purpose. Some of the more common types of networks are:

-   **Local Area Network (LAN)**: A LAN is considered an individual network limited to a local geographical area. Typically consisting of end-user devices (i.e. computers, printers, storage devices, etc.), a LAN may facilitate connections between devices via switches and hubs.
    
-   **Metropolitan Area Network (MAN)**: A MAN is a network that consists of LANs interconnected across a large area such as a college campus, small town, or a large city. MANs require the routing of network traffic.
    
-   **Personal Area Network (PAN)**: Typically associated with Bluetooth, a PAN is a wireless mobile device network established over a short distance.
    
-   **Wide Area Network (WAN)**: A WAN is the largest network type since it may occupy areas covering entire countries or even the entire world. The _internet_ falls under the category of a WAN.
    

## Conclusion

The topics discussed in this article are some of the foundations of computer networking. To properly protect something one must understand how it works, first. Computer networking may seem complex, but, with a bit of study, you can gain this knowledge to become an effective Cybersecurity Analyst.


# The OSI Model

Learn about the OSI model.

## What is the OSI model?

How a single bit travels from one computer to the next is a complex concept. In 1984, the **open systems interconnection (OSI) model** was published as a framework for network communication. The model breaks down computer network communication into seven layers. All of the layers work together to create a digital message. The message is built as it moves _down_ the protocol stack. However, it is not sent to another network until it reaches the physical layer.

![This shows 7 layers of the OSI conceptual model. Including the Application, Presentation, Session, Transport, Network, Data-link, and Physical layers.](https://static-assets.codecademy.com/Paths/cybersecurity-analyst-career-path/cybersecurity-analyst-interview-prep/general-knowledge/networking/Cybersecurity_NetworkModelDiagram_v4-01.svg)

The model _helps IT, computer science, and cybersecurity professionals_ understand how a single bit travels from one computer to the next by breaking the system into these layers.

From physical devices to user interfaces (UI), this model explains the communication role of each layer in overall computer networking. This article will start by introducing the Physical Layer (Layer 1).

### Layer 1: the physical layer

The _physical layer_ is where data moves across network interfaces as digital signals. Additionally, this is where the transmitting and receiving of network communication occurs. Starting with the Application Layer the message moves down the OSI model, and it eventually reaches the Physical Layer for transmission. When the message is received by the physical layer, the message will then move up the OSI layers until it reaches the final application layer.

![An animated gif showing an arrow saying "Transmit" arrow wiping into view from the top layer (layer 8) to the bottom layer (layer 1). Then, a wave of "bits" moves from left to right (from the transmitter to the receiver). Lastly, an arrow saying "Receive" arrow should wipe from the bottom layer to the top.](https://static-assets.codecademy.com/Paths/cybersecurity-analyst-career-path/cybersecurity-analyst-interview-prep/general-knowledge/networking/Art-1564-OSI-Physical-Layer-Transfer.gif)

### Layer 2: data-link layer

Electrical signals received (or transmitted) to the physical layer are linked and translated to digital logic in the _data-Link layer_. Computer devices may be networked at the Data-Link layer, but only as a Local Area Network (LAN). Connecting a LAN to another LAN occurs at Layer 3.

Within Layer 2, the **Protocol Data Unit** (PDU) known as a **frame** consists of a header, footer, and data. Understanding how a frame is structured is important for network traffic analysis.

![An image showing an IEEE 802.3 Ethernet Frame Format. It starts with a Preamble that is 7 bytes, then an SFD that is 1 byte, a destination address that is 6 bytes, a source address that is 6 bytes, a length of 2 bytes, data that is 46 to 1500 bytes, and CRC that is 4 bytes.](https://static-assets.codecademy.com/Paths/cybersecurity-analyst-career-path/cybersecurity-analyst-interview-prep/general-knowledge/networking/Ethernet%20Frame%20PDU.svg)

Additionally, within Layer 2, **physical addresses** are assigned and are also known as _MAC addresses_ and/or _hardware addresses_ in networking. MAC addresses are unique to each device on a local network. They are 48-bits in length and are assigned in hexadecimal characters.

![An image showing a MAC address.](https://static-assets.codecademy.com/Paths/cybersecurity-analyst-career-path/cybersecurity-analyst-interview-prep/general-knowledge/networking/MAC%20Address.svg)

Some other things to note about Layer 2 is that there are a few protocols that reside in it that we should know about:

-   **Ethernet**: The most common type of LAN, Ethernet is the standard used to connect computing devices, routers, and switches in a wired network.
-   **IEEE 802.11**: “Wi-Fi” or “Wireless LAN.”
-   **Fiber Distributed Data Interface (FDDI)**: Network standard for fiber optic LAN connections.
-   **Link Layer Discovery Protocol (LLDP)**: A Link Layer protocol used for advertising neighbors, identity, and capabilities on a LAN.
-   **Address Resolution Protocol (ARP)**: Converts and links Internet Protocol (IP) addresses to MAC addresses on a LAN.
-   **Cisco Discovery Protocol (CDP)**: Similar to LLDP, but Cisco proprietary. The protocol collects neighbor information of directly connected LAN devices.

Additionally, Layer 2 is split into two sublayers:

-   **Logical Link Control (LLC)**: Responsible for establishing the logical link between devices on a local network.
-   **Media Access Control (MAC)**: Responsible for the procedures used by devices across a network medium.

### Layer 3: network layer

When we think of the internet, we are thinking of interconnected networks. Interconnecting networks refer to a Local Area Network (LAN) connection to neighboring or remote networks. Layer 3 of the OSI model, the _network layer_, is where internetworking takes place and is where **logical addresses** are assigned to networked devices. A primary function of this layer is to route network packets from one LAN to another. Routing requires IP addresses and logical mapping of other networks across the internet to properly deliver messages. Another important function of Layer 3 is its ability to fragment and reassemble large communication. When Layer 3 passes a message down to Layer 2 for transmission, message length limits may be encountered in some cases.

Additionally, Layer 3 is the layer where the protocols used to route communication between networks reside. A few common network protocols are:

-   **Internet Protocol (IP)**: IPv4 and IPv6 are two versions of IP, and _IPv4 is the most common protocol of the Internet_.
-   **Internet Protocol Secure (IPSec)**: A more secure version of IP which leverages cryptography.
-   **Routing Information Protocol (RIP)**: Distance-vector routing protocol that uses hop count as a metric of routing.
-   **Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol (EiGRP)**: Cisco proprietary. A distance-vectoring protocol used for automating network configurations and routing decisions.
-   **Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP)**: Network protocol used for error reporting of network issues.
-   **Border Gateway Protocol (BGP)**: A routing protocol designed to exchange routing information automatically on the internet.

Within Layer 3, the **Protocol Data Unit** (PDU) is the **packet**. Packets encapsulate data intended for transmission with header and footer data.

![An image showing how data might be organized in an IPv4 Header.](https://static-assets.codecademy.com/Paths/cybersecurity-analyst-career-path/cybersecurity-analyst-interview-prep/general-knowledge/networking/IPv4%20Header.svg)

The IPv4 protocol encapsulates data with IPv4 header information necessary for delivery. For example, the 32-bit packet format contains the source address, the destination address, protocol, time-to-live (TTL), etc. in the IPv4 header data.

### Layer 4: transport layer

The _transport layer_, Layer 4, is responsible for being the go-between the abstract layers of the OSI model (Layers 7-5) and the concrete communication layers (Layers 3-1).

Depending on the type of application, the transportation of that application’s communication will need to be handled in a specific way. For example, basic web browsing communication uses [**Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)**](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/general/http). HTTP communicates via a specific connection service type and port. The transport layer is responsible for delivering/receiving the HTTP communication and maintaining the connection throughout the HTTP communication.

The Protocol Data Unit (PDU) at Layer 4 is known as a data **segment**. Segmentation is the process of dividing raw data into smaller pieces. Once the raw data is packaged from the higher _application layers_ it is segmented at the transport layer before being passed to the Network Layer.

![An image showing a message from a sender being segmented in the transport layer, passed into the network layer, and then being reassembled in the transport layer before going to the recipient.](https://static-assets.codecademy.com/Paths/cybersecurity-analyst-career-path/cybersecurity-analyst-interview-prep/general-knowledge/networking/Transport%20layer.svg)

The transport layer protocols are divided into two categories depending on their connection service type:

#### Connection-oriented services

This connection type establishes a logical connection between two devices prior to beginning communication across a network. Connection-oriented protocols typically maintain service connection by following a set of rules that **initiate, negotiate, manage, and terminate** the communication. The Transport Layer protocols will also **retransmit** any data that is received without acknowledgment. The most common Connection-Oriented protocol is the **Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)** and its process to manage a connection between two devices is called the _Three-Way Handshake_. In TCP communication, the communicating devices typically share a client/server relationship where a client initiates communication with a service. The handshake involves the process of sending special TCP messages to synchronize a state of negotiated connection in communication.

#### Connectionless services

In connectionless communication, the protocol does not establish a connection between client and server. Instead, once a request is made to the server, the server sends all data without initiation, negotiation, or management of connection. Connectionless protocols also do not attempt to correct any interruptions in data transmission. Once the server sends the data, the server is not concerned if the client receives it.

![An image comparing TCP to UDP communication.](https://static-assets.codecademy.com/Paths/cybersecurity-analyst-career-path/cybersecurity-analyst-interview-prep/general-knowledge/networking/TCP%20vs%20UDP.svg)

When TCP or UDP are used to establish communication, the communication is assigned a **port** as the Layer 4 address. A port is a logical assignment given to processes and their respective application protocols on a computing system. A few important facts to memorize about ports are:

-   There are 65,535 valid port numbers available to assign to a communication process.
-   Ports 0 - 1023 are **Well-Known Ports**: Assigned to universal TCP/IP application protocols. These protocols are the most common such as HTTPS, SSH, FTP, DNS, and the list goes on. They are registered to these protocols by a global
-   Ports 1024 - 49,151 are **Registered Ports**: Reserved for application protocols that are not specified as universal TCP/IP application protocols.
-   Ports 49,152 - 65,535 are **Private/Dynamic Ports**: These ports may be used for any process without the need to register the port with the global assigning authority.
-   When TCP and IP are used together, a Layer 4 port and a Layer 3 IP address are assigned to the connection. This is called a socket. For example, 8.8.8.8:443 is a socket indicating that communication to IP address 8.8.8.8 is to connect to port 443 on the server.

### Layer 5: session layer

The _session layer_ starts, manages, and terminates sessions between end-user application processes. Sessions are considered the persistent connection between devices. A session is application-focused; sessions are not concerned with layers 1-4. Instead, the session layer controls _dialog_ between two networked devices. It is considered to facilitate host-to-host communication. Sessions dialog may be controlled through _synchronization_ checkpoints, and through management of communication modes. There are two modes of communication permitted at Layer 5:

-   **Half-Duplex**: Communication travels in both directions between sender and receiver, but only one device may transmit a message at a time.
-   **Full-Duplex**: Communication travels in both directions between sender and receiver, and messages may be sent simultaneously in either direction.

The session layer resembles a phone conversation. For example, when a person picks up a phone and calls someone else a session is created. Once the communication on the call is completed, the session is terminated by hanging up the phone. In computing, software applications are making the phone call and establishing a session.

Two common Layer 5 protocols still used today are:

-   NetBIOS
-   Remote Procedure Call (RPC)

### Layer 6: presentation layer

The _presentation layer_ is primarily responsible for presenting data so that the recipient will understand the data. Data **formatting and encoding** protocols apply at Layer 6 to ensure data is legible and presented properly in the application receiving it. Data **compression** is also a function of Layer 6. If necessary, data may be compressed to improve data throughput over network communication.

Some common Layer 6 protocols are **ASCII**, **JPEG**, **GIF**, **MPEG**, and **PNG**.

Another main function of the presentation layer is the **encryption and decryption** of data sent across a network. Most encryption communication protocols straddle multiple layers of the OSI model, but the actual encryption function is Layer 6.

Two of the most common secure communication protocols are:

-   Transport Layer Security (TLS)
-   Secure Socket Layer (SSL)

### Layer 7: application layer

The topmost layer of the OSI model is the _application layer_. On computer systems, applications display information to the user via the UI.

> **Note**: Software applications running on a computer are NOT considered to reside in the application layer. Instead, they leverage application layer services and protocols that enable network communication.

For example, the user can craft messages and access the network from the application layer. A web browser application allows a user to access a web page. The user may input information and receive information through the web browser. However, the application layer protocol HTTP performs the network communication function. The web browser and HTTP work closely together, and the distinction between the two may be subtle. Yet, HTTP is the web browsing protocol for all web browser applications. In contrast, no single web browser software exclusively utilizes HTTP.

HTTP is one of many common application layer protocols. Below are a few additional protocols to know. It is also good practice to memorize the associated port assigned to the protocols:

Protocol

Port Number(s)

Description

**Domain Name System** (DNS)

53

Translates internet names to their globally registered IP addresses. For example, “google.com” is registered in global DNS as IP address 8.8.8.8.

**Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure** (HTTPS)

443

Sends data to and from web browsers and web servers, but securely with the Secure Socket Layer (SSL) protocol.

**File Transfer Protocol** FTP

20, 21

Transfers files from a client to a server and vice versa.

**Secure Shell** (SSH)

22

Connects to computers remotely and in a secure, encrypted way.

**Simple Mail Transfer Protocol** (SMTP)

25

Sends and receives email.

**Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol** (DHCP)

67

Automatically assigns IP addresses to devices on a network.

**Internet Relay Chat** (IRC)

194

Used in a client/server method. IRC clients communicate through an IRC server.

**Post Office Protocol 3** (POP3)

110 (unsecured), 995 (secured)

Used for email where the client receives mail by downloading it locally to a computer from a server mailbox.

## Conclusion

The OSI model breaks down computer network communication into seven layers. All of the layers work together to create a digital message. Understanding the OSI model will help you communicate with other network technologists. Computer networking may seem complex, but, with a bit of study, you can gain this knowledge to become an effective Cybersecurity Analyst.


# TCP/IP and Bluetooth

In this article, you’ll learn more about TCP/IP.

## TCP/IP Model

### What is the TCP/IP Model?

Modern internetworking primarily leverages TCP and IP as the standard suite for computer communication. What this means is that the _internet_ as we use it depends on the TCP/IP duo to allow us to communicate across it. The TCP/IP Model incorporates the OSI Model and represents it in a framework focused on TCP/IP.

The TCP/IP Model reduces the 7 OSI layers into 4 TCP/IP layers. The top 3 layers (Application, Presentation, and Session Layers) of the OSI Model are consolidated into a single Application Layer. The Transport and Network Layers remain the same. The Data-Link and Physical Layers of the OSI Model are consolidated into the Network Interface Layer.

![An image showing TCP/IP and the OSI model side by side.](https://static-assets.codecademy.com/Paths/cybersecurity-analyst-career-path/cybersecurity-analyst-interview-prep/general-knowledge/networking/Cybersecurity_OSI_TCP-IP_Diagram_1-13.svg)

This consolidation of layers makes understanding the TCP/IP protocol stack fundamentally simpler from the perspective of networking. In networking, the lower 3 layers of the TCP/IP Model focus on the networking aspect of modern computing. Referring back to the top 3 OSI Model layers (Application, Presentation, Session), remember that this is where the more abstract software application layer functions begin. The abstract software application layers do not play critical roles in the internetworking role of the TCP/IP stack like the Transport, Network, and Network Interface Layers do. This is also true from the digitally logical perspective of network communication.

## Protocol Data Units (PDU) and Encapsulation

Throughout the OSI Model layer explanations of this article you’ve seen the term **Protocol Data Units** (PDU) used for Layers 2, 3, and 4. Understanding what each PDU is, and a general understanding of how they are formatted, is highly beneficial to the cybersecurity analyst.

### Protocol Data Units at Each TCP/IP Layer

A review of the PDU formats at each layer, we understand the following:

-   The PDU of the top three abstract application layers is **data**.
-   The PDU of the Transport Layer is **segment**.
-   The PDU of the Network Layer is the **packet**.
-   The PDU of the Data Link Layer is the **frame**.

Application Layer

Presentation Layer

Session Layer

Transport Layer

Segments

### TCP/IP Encapsulation

Encapsulation is the process of enclosing a message within the appropriate PDU headers and footers to allow transfer across computer networks.

Why is encapsulation important to analysts? One important benefit of understanding TCP/IP encapsulation in-depth is the technical understanding of how computers communicate. Perhaps a daily role of a Cybersecurity Analyst is to perform packet-level analysis of network traffic incoming and outgoing to an organization. To properly perform the analysis of the network traffic, a strong understanding of encapsulation is necessary. Visual representations of encapsulation demonstrate how data gets wrapped in the segment header as it reaches the Transport Layer. Then, the segment gets wrapped in packet headers, and so on until the message is finally transmitted as 1s and 0s.

![An image showing how data travels through the layers.](https://static-assets.codecademy.com/Paths/cybersecurity-analyst-career-path/cybersecurity-analyst-interview-prep/general-knowledge/networking/IP%20Encapsulation.svg)

Fully understanding encapsulation may answer the question, “How does my request to view a Codecademy article page actually get to Codecademy?” From a technical TCP/IP breakdown:

The web browser application initiates a request upon a user’s click of their mouse. The browser packages the request as a datagram and pushes the request down to the Transport layer. The Transport Layer splits the data into segments, encapsulates each segment, and passes each segment with the appropriate port address to the Network Layer. The port assigned is 443 since the HTTPS protocol is used as the application layer communication protocol. The Network Layer encapsulates each segment with packet headers in preparation for internetwork traversal before passing it to the Data-Link Layer. The Data-Link Layer encapsulates the packet with frame headers. Then it passes it to the Physical Layer. The Physical Layer transmits each frame as ones and zeros. Eventually, the request gets routed to the Codecademy web server where the TCP/IP process is done in reverse to decapsulate the frame, packet, segment, and data of the transmitted message.

In fact, understanding encapsulation and the PDU format at each level, as well as the protocol-specific header/footer data of each PDU is vital to properly analyzing network traffic in-depth. For example, an ICMP packet will not contain segment headers because it is a Layer 3 protocol. Compared to a DNS packet which contains segment headers and Application Layer data.

## Bluetooth

Bluetooth is a wireless communication standard designed for mobile devices, computers, and other electronic devices to talk over a short range. As mentioned earlier, Bluetooth communicates over a PAN, or Personal Area Network. With Bluetooth, data may be transferred across devices with confidence due to the added security features of the standard. Not to be confused with Radio-Frequency Identification (RFID) which establishes communication between an RFID tag and an RFID reader, Bluetooth is diverse in the number of different devices that use it.

### Bluetooth Protocol Stack

Bluetooth does not directly translate to the OSI or TCP/IP Models. Bluetooth follows the Bluetooth Protocol Stack Model. The Bluetooth Protocol Stack adds a bit more complexity between application and audio layers since there are numerous protocol groupings that reside _at the same layer_.

![An image showing the Bluetooth Protocol Stack.](https://static-assets.codecademy.com/Paths/cybersecurity-analyst-career-path/cybersecurity-analyst-interview-prep/general-knowledge/networking/Bluetooth%20Protocol%20Stack.svg)

The Bluetooth Protocol Stack is halved at the **Host Controller Interface** (HCI) where the layers above the are considered the _Host System_ layers, and the layers below the HCI are considered the _Bluetooth System_.

![An image showing the Bluetooth Protocol Stack next to the OSI Model Layers.](https://static-assets.codecademy.com/Paths/cybersecurity-analyst-career-path/cybersecurity-analyst-interview-prep/general-knowledge/networking/Bluetooth%20Protocol%20Stack%202.svg)

The Bluetooth Protocol Stack categorizes protocols by function:

-   **Core Protocols**: These are the protocols that foundationally allow the Bluetooth standard to work. They include Radio, Baseband, Link Manager Protocol (LMP), Logical Link Control and Adaptation Protocol (L2CAP), and Service Discovery Protocol (SDP). Each of the core protocols serves an important role in Bluetooth:
    
-   **Radio**: This is considered the Physical Layer of the OSI Protocol Stack. Instead of electrical signals on a cable, the Radio protocols define the interface, frequency, modulation techniques, etc. of Bluetooth communication.
    
-   **Baseband**: The Baseband Layer is similar to Layer 2 of the OSI Model where the physical signal is translated into a logical format. The Baseband will give the radio communication an address, structure the frame or packet, and perform other Bluetooth-specific functions.
    
-   **LMP**: The LMP maintains the logical link between Bluetooth devices and is responsible for authentication, message size, and encryption.
    
-   **L2CAP**: Adapts upper layers to lower Baseband. Similar to TCP, the L2CAP protocol can use connection-oriented or connectionless communication methods.
    
-   **SDP**: The protocol responsible for establishing connections between Bluetooth devices. This protocol will process device information to enable a connection to that specific device.
    
-   **Cable Replacement Protocols**: Protocols used to interface with the Wireless Application Protocol (WAP). The most common cable replacement protocol in Bluetooth is the Radio Frontend Component or RFComm.
    
-   **Adopted Protocols**: Adopted protocols are protocols found in the OSI Model that are leveraged by the Bluetooth standard. Common protocols like IP, TCP, UDP, and WAP fall under the adopted protocol category.
    

## Conclusion

Understanding the TCP/IP will help you communicate with other technology professionals. Computer networking may seem complex, but, with a bit of study, you can gain this knowledge to become an effective Cybersecurity Analyst.


# Network Security

Dive into Network Security review!

## Network Security

### Network Devices

Different security devices operate at different layers of the OSI model. To recap, basic networking devices found in Layer 2 and 3 are Switches, Bridges/Hubs, Network Interface Cards (NIC), Wireless Access Points (WAP), and Routers.

#### Networking Devices at Layer 2

At Layer 2, we are using protocols like Ethernet. Devices communicate using MAC addresses, and switching and forwarding are the functions of devices at this layer.

-   **Switches**: Reduces network collisions because each port of a switch is an individual collision domain. Contains logic to filter traffic appropriately.
-   **Bridges/Hubs**: No logic. Broadcast incoming traffic out every port.
-   **Network Interface Cards (NIC)**: Hardware network component on each computing device. May be integrated or attached via external port(s).
-   **Wireless Access Points (WAP)**: Computers connecting to a wireless network connect wirelessly to a WAP.

#### Networking Devices at Layer 3

Layer 3 is the layer where network-to-network packet routing takes place.

-   **Routers**: Device used to route internetwork traffic between networks.
-   **Layer 3 Switches**: A switch equipped with Layer 3 routing logic features.

### Network Defenses

From the security perspective, it is important to be able to identify security network devices at each layer. Something to keep in mind is that defenses may be hardware _or_ software solutions.

#### Firewalls

A firewall is a technology whose purpose is to allow or deny network traffic ingress (incoming) and egress (outgoing). Firewalls follow a set of rules that define which traffic to block or allow into a network or computing device.

For example, if a network does not want traffic incoming from known malicious IP addresses, then a set of rules may be set in the network firewall to deny all traffic from those addresses from entering the network. Typically, the methods for firewalling fall under two terms: **allowlisting** and **denylisting** (previously “whitelisting” and “blacklisting”).

-   **Allowlisting**: A method of firewalling where ALL connections are _blocked_ except a list of specifically defined _acceptable_ connections.
-   **Denylisting**: A firewall method where ALL connections are _allowed_ except a list of specifically defined _unacceptable_ connections.

_Types of Firewalls_: There are a few different types of firewalls used in network security. Each type of firewall analyzes network traffic in different ways:

```
Web Application: Also known as WAFs (web application firewalls), WAFs protect applications and web servers from specific server attacks. It does this by inspecting and analyzing the HTTP traffic for signs of attack. The WAF will monitor the traffic and filter or block any unwanted HTTP traffic. 
```

Packet-Filtering: A packet filtering firewall focuses on Layer 3 and 4 traffic. This type of firewall will inspect the header information of a packet such as a source IP, destination IP, source port, destination port, and protocol. Stateful Packet-Filtering: A stateful packet-filtering firewall is the same thing as a regular packet-filtering firewall except it tracks the entire state of the network conversation as an additional function. Whether it is connection-oriented or connectionless Layer 4 communication, the stateful packet-filtering firewall will track the entire communication and drop any packets that deviate from the appropriate connection state.

_Hardware Firewalls_: Similar to switches and routers, a firewall appliance may be physically placed in a communication closet with other network devices. Logically, the firewall will be strategically placed in a few different places, depending on the security needs of an organization. For example, one of the most common places to place a firewall is between the internet-facing router and the internal-facing router. Firewalls that are installed inside the network are considered network-based since their role is to filter the general traffic of a network.

![An image showing a firewall, that is on fire, between the internet and an organization's internal network.](https://static-assets.codecademy.com/Paths/cybersecurity-analyst-career-path/cybersecurity-analyst-interview-prep/general-knowledge/networking/Firewall%20placement.svg)

_Software Firewalls_: Not all firewalls are dedicated hardware devices. Some firewalls are simply software installed on a client computer or server. These types of firewalls are considered to be host-based since they only filter the network traffic of the host in which they are installed.

_Intrusion Detection System (IDS)_: A system that monitors the activity on a network or host, detecting suspicious/malicious activity, and alerting administrators and security professionals. An IDS is designed to quickly identify common attack patterns and/or designed to identify anomalous behavior that requires attention depending on the type of IDS:

_Host-based_: Just like the host-based firewall filters traffic for a single device, a host-based IDS monitors the activity on a single computer or server.

_Network-based_: An IDS that is monitoring and analyzing activity of a whole network.

_Signature-based_: An IDS that looks for activity matching an attack signature. Behavior-based: For behavior IDS, the activity of a host or network is compared to a baseline activity profile that defines the appropriate normal behavior of the host or network.

_Intrusion Prevention System (IPS)_: An IPS is almost identical to an IDS in role and function, except an IPS will automatically respond to any intrusion events it may detect by executing preventative actions. The types of IPS match that of the IDS: host-based, network-based, signature-based, behavior-based.

_Wireless Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems (WIDPS)_: IDS and IPS that monitor wireless signals for security threats and rogue WAPs.

_Proxy Servers_: Proxy servers focus on Application Layer network connections. Used as an intermediary between the internal clients and external servers (i.e. the internet). Proxy servers will provide computer anonymity since the requests coming out of a network are handled by the proxy on behalf of the users. Proxies also protect the computers behind it since it is the device that is public-facing, making the proxy the device that would absorb an attack instead of internal computers. In other words, the proxy server will sit between the internal network and the internet, hence it is both internal-facing and public-facing. This is the most common type of proxy server, but there are other implementations of proxies.

Another type of proxy is the “reverse proxy”. A reverse proxy faces in-ward to filter the incoming traffic. For example, to protect a web server from specific types of traffic, a proxy may be set up in front of the webserver. The proxy will then proceed to respond to the client accessing the web server as if it is the webserver. The client will have no knowledge that it is a proxy sending the response on behalf of the webserver.

In fact, there are two modes of proxy: transparent and nontransparent. The transparent proxy will not modify the traffic passing through it, whereas a non-transparent proxy will modify network traffic to add additional information to the communication service.

_Antivirus_: Software that detects malware such as viruses, worms, rootkits, etc. on a client computer or server. Antivirus may detect malicious applications or code by scanning files on a system and running processes. Antivirus software uses a few different methods of detecting malicious software on a system: signature-based, behavior-based, and integrity-based.

_Honeypots_: A computer created to deceive an intruder or insider threat. A honeypot will be a system on a network that serves as a decoy and/or a trap for an attacker. It will look like a legitimate system that will lure the attacker to it instead of production systems.

_Honeynets_: Same as a honeypot, but involving two or more networked honeypots.

## Conclusion

The topics discussed in this article are the foundation of computer networking. To properly protect something we have to understand how it works. Computer networking may seem complex, but with a bit of study, this necessary knowledge to be an effective Cybersecurity Analyst will be gained.



# Linux OS

A Cybersecurity Analyst is expected to effectively analyze the operating systems of an organization. In this article, we’ll discuss the Linux OS.

## What we’ll be learning

Most organizations today use more than ten different computer systems in their network infrastructure! Whether it’s a client, a server, or a mobile device, computer systems require operating systems (OS) to function. There are many different OSs a Cybersecurity Analyst may encounter, and it’s beneficial to be familiar with the common ones.

After this article, you will:

-   Understand OSs.
-   Explain the OS and its fundamental architecture.
-   Understand the Linux OS.
-   Understand the Windows client and server OSs.
-   Clearly distinguish the differences between Linux, Windows, and other OSs.
-   Explain hypervisors and virtualization.
-   Explain how mobile device OSs differ from other OSs.
-   Understand OS hardening practices for many OSs.
-   Clearly identify different file systems.
-   Understand cloud computing’s relationship to OS security.
-   Understand BYOD practices and their security implications.

## What is an OS?

### Computer architecture

A _computer’s architecture_ is all the parts required for a computer system to function. Computer architecture refers to the interrelationship between the hardware of the system ([RAM](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/blog/what-is-ram/), chipsets, hard disk drives, [CPU](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/blog/what-is-a-cpu/), logic busses, etc.) and the software, specifically the OS. A computer’s hardware architecture must align with the OS architecture for a computer to work. The major components and terms of computer architecture that the cybersecurity analyst may want to learn more about are:

-   The Central Processing Unit (CPU)
-   Multiprocessing
-   Multithreading
-   Memory Management
    -   Random Access Memory (RAM)
    -   Read-Only Memory (ROM)
    -   Cache Memory
    -   Virtual Memory

Just like the parts of a car engine, the hardware and software that come in stock in a computer may be uninstalled and replaced with alternative components. For example, a Seagate hard disk drive that comes installed on a laptop may be easily replaced by a Samsung solid-state drive.

An OS also has many different options, but what exactly is an OS?

### The OS

The OS creates the environment where users interact with applications and leverages the underlying hardware of a system. Joining an OS with computer hardware makes the complete system. The OS is the software that dictates what a computer can do. OSs are very complex and have many responsibilities in computing because they must be able to manage the processing, I/O operations, memory, etc.

![A diagram of the hardware, OS, and end user.](https://static-assets.codecademy.com/Paths/cybersecurity-analyst-career-path/cybersecurity-analyst-interview-prep/general-knowledge/operating-systems/Levels%20of%20an%20OS.svg)

There are many different OSs. The most common OS used for personal computing are Microsoft’s Windows and Apple’s macOS. Most personal computers (PC) come pre-loaded with Microsoft Windows, while all Mac PCs have MacOS installed.

> **Note**: OSs are not only used for laptop and desktop computers! Mobile devices also run mobile OSs.

_Every OS demands security_. Each type of OS, whether desktop, mobile, server, or hypervisor, will require different techniques to properly secure them. As a cybersecurity analyst, it is important to understand each OS fundamentally, technically, and functionally.

### Architecture of an OS

All modern OSs are broken down to a duet of layers known as the **kernel** and the **shell**.

The kernel is the core layer of the OS that directly interfaces with, and manages, the hardware of a computer system. Code executed in a computer’s CPU runs in two modes: kernel mode or user mode. The kernel runs in kernel mode and interfaces with the “user-level” where all applications run. There are a few different types of kernels:

-   **Monolithic Kernel**: all computer processes run in kernel mode
-   **Microkernel**: core processes run in kernel mode while remaining processes run in user mode
-   **Hybrid Microkernel**: all processes run in kernel mode where core processes run in microkernel and the remaining processes run in client/server mode

Older OS operated in a monolithic architecture where the kernel’s core processes were not separated from other processes. OS architectures evolved into a more hybrid architecture seen in modern OS. The separation of kernel and shell keeps the kernel more isolated, protected, and organized. The shell allows users and applications to communicate with the kernel and utilize the hardware resources of a computer system. Applications and utilities are the “User space” of an OS since users use applications and some shell tools to interact with the kernel and hardware.

![An image of the application and kernel space.](https://static-assets.codecademy.com/Paths/cybersecurity-analyst-career-path/cybersecurity-analyst-interview-prep/general-knowledge/operating-systems/User%20Space%20vs%20Kernel%20Space.svg)

## Linux

### The Linux kernel

One of the most common OS kernels utilized in modern computing is the Linux kernel. Linux is an open-source OS that was designed to resemble the UNIX OS, but Linux has evolved to be utilized in systems used for many different purposes. The Linux kernel is used in PCs, servers, mobile devices, and in many other computing devices. There are numerous Linux OS in distribution, but one thing that remains constant across every Linux OS is the Linux kernel. In other words, a Linux distribution is an OS that uses a version of the Linux kernel and a unique set of shell applications.

### Linux distributions

Now that we’ve emphasized the significance of the OS kernel, the shell, and highlighted the Linux kernel, we can explore the concept of the Linux distribution. There are hundreds of Linux OS distributions. Each Linux distribution is unique in purpose and consists of different application packages (and shells). Some Linux distributions remain open source while others are converted to proprietary OS licensed by certain Linux OS vendors.

As a cybersecurity professional, understanding the characteristics of the Linux OS is critical in the analyst function especially since the OS is used with many cybersecurity tools. In fact, there are a few Linux distributions whose purpose is penetration testing and cybersecurity analysis. The most popular of these types of Linux OS is Kali Linux which will be discussed later.

### The Linux command-line interface

Linux, when compared to other OS, is distinguished by many characteristics such as the filesystem and command-line interface (CLI) syntax. It should also be mentioned that it is common to interact with popular Linux OS used in organization’s computer infrastructure via command-line only. Most production grade Linux OS come out-of-the-box without a graphical user interface (GUI). Instead, the OS interface displayed to the user may simply be a command-line shell like the image below.

To effectively navigate the Linux OS, the user must be familiar with the Linux CLI syntax and the different shells available to the user. The most common Linux shell is the Bash shell.

### The Linux file system

OSs, before they are loaded into memory and activated as processes, are simply files of code. Therefore, it is important to understand where the core OS files reside in an OS file system. Kernel files are typically stored in default locations in an OSs file system, while shell and application files change locations depending on OS version. Additionally, different OS have different file systems which add complexity to the cybersecurity professionals job of securing all systems of an organization. For example, the Linux file system differs significantly to the Microsoft Windows file system. Linux uses Extended Filesystem 4 (EXT4), while Windows uses New Technology FileSystem (NTFS). As an analyst, familiarization with the file system of each OS encountered is important.

**/**    Root Directory of the Linux Files System (FS)
│
└─── **/bin**    User Binaries
│
└─── **/boot**    Boot Loader Files
│
└─── **/dev**    Device Files
│
└─── **/etc**    System-Global Config Files
│
└─── **/home**    User’s Home Directory
│

│
└─── **/tmp**    Temporary Files Directory
│
└─── **/usr**    User Utilities and Applications
|
└─── **/var**    Variable Files

The Linux file system structure begins at the root. Root is identified by a single forward slash “/”. In the Linux CLI, navigating to the root of the Linux OS may be done so by simply typing “cd /”. Root is the top directory in the hierarchy of the Linux OS. From root, all other system directories are available. Here are a few of the directories that cybersecurity analysts should get familiar with:

-   `/boot`: Directory that stores kernel files and boot loader files.
-   `/dev`: Device files of every hardware device connected to the system are stored here.
-   `/etc`: Startup scripts, login files, and configuration files for common system services are stored here.
-   `/lib`: Stores system library files and kernel module files.
-   `/proc`: Stores data that gets loaded into memory such as: kernel, process, network, etc.
-   `/sbin`: Stores binaries and commands related to the system environments settings.
-   `/sys`: Stores kernel-related information that typically gets loaded directly into memory upon boot.
-   `/var`: Location where system variable files are stored. Dynamic data, log files, cache data, and files generated during system operation are stored here too.

### Basic Linux security

Out-of-the-box, most Linux OS require specific hardening techniques to be applied upon installation. It is good practice to know how to properly secure the OS being installed. With Linux, these basic hardening steps should be applied:

#### Document host information

Any system joined to an enterprise network should be properly documented. Address information should be recorded, as well as other specific host information (hostname, hardware serials, etc.)

#### Secure the BIOS

The Basic Input/Output System (BIOS) has access to system resources and configuration settings that may be used to alter the bootloader method of an OS. This may be leveraged to compromise a system, therefore securing a BIOS, at a minimum, with a password is good practice.

#### Encrypt storage

Encrypting the hard disks, whether encrypting individual files or applying full-disk encryption (FDE), is a good practice. This technique prevents unauthorized theft/access to the data on a systems storage device(s).

#### Set /boot Directory to Read-Only

Since the /boot directory contains critical kernel files, it’s a good idea to eliminate the possibility of unwanted file alterations in the /boot directory.

#### Disable unused hardware port(s)

Data Loss Prevention (DLP) practices suggest that all unused hardware ports should be disabled (typically in the BIOS). The most important ports to disable are USB ports, since they may be leveraged to load malicious software and compromise a system.

#### Disable unused logical port(s)

Disable any open connections unneeded on the system. Any open connection ports are an entry point to a computer system. Therefore, to reduce the compromise risk, close all unused connection ports.

#### Enable SE Linux

Security-enhanced Linux uses a security mechanism that hardens the kernel significantly. By simply enabling this mechanism, layers of security are added to the Linux kernel of the system.

#### Properly configure file permissions

The files **passwd**, **group**, and **shadow** are unique to Linux and are where user logins, passwords, and group information are stored. Restricting ownership and permissions of these files to the root account and root group greatly improves the overall security of account compromise of the system.

#### Enforce strong password policies

Ensure the passwords stored on the system are not reused and that the password length and complexity minimum requirements are sufficient to prevent password attacks.

#### Patch, patch, patch

Maintain the system as up-to-date as possible. System and application patches contain vital security updates that help reduce system vulnerabilities and increase security.

These are only a few of the most basic hardening techniques when securing a Linux OS. To learn additional Linux OS hardening steps, read the article [“Linux Hardening”](https://www.codecademy.com/courses/introduction-to-cybersecurity/articles/linux-hardening).

# Windows OS

A Cybersecurity Analyst is expected to effectively analyze the operating systems of an organization. In this article, we’ll discuss the Windows OS.

## Microsoft

Microsoft is a pioneer of the Personal Computer (PC), productivity software, and now cloud technology. It is almost guaranteed that the organization you will be responsible for securing will utilize Microsoft products. Therefore, familiarization of the most common technologies Microsoft offers is vital in the analyst practice. In this article, the focus is the Microsoft OS: Windows and Server.

### Microsoft Windows

Microsoft’s desktop OS product is Windows. Windows is a proprietary OS meaning that its source code is completely sealed and modifications are not authorized unless permitted by the software developer, Microsoft.

When it comes to security, the choice of OS is important. Out-of-the-box, Windows provides basic security that other OS may not, and newer versions are equipped with stronger security tools and features, but it is a very utilized OS in enterprise and personal computing. It is also due to its high distribution and use, Windows is a big target to cyberattack. In fact, most of the malware in existence is targeted towards Microsoft’s operating systems. As a Cybersecurity Analyst, Windows may be the OS you’ll most encounter. Therefore, understanding the OS and how to properly secure it is a priority.

Just like other OS, Windows is split into two modes: user mode and kernel mode, yet kernel mode in Windows is much more complex than the simplicity of Linux’s kernel mode. Kernel mode in Windows incorporates everything from the hardware abstraction layer (HAL) to the system services. It is beneficial to familiarize yourself with the many components of the Windows kernel mode, as well as the core components of user mode.

### New Technology File Systems (NTFS)

As mentioned earlier, Windows uses NTFS. In Windows, the root directory is represented by a backslash (“\”). Unlike Linux where the slash is preceded by username@hostname, Windows precedes root with the drive letter (%driveletter%) of the device volumen on which it is installed. The default drive letter assigned out-of-the-box is C:. Here are a few Windows directories that a Cybersecurity Analyst should be familiar with:

**C:\**  Root Directory of the Windows Files System (FS).
│
└─── **\Program Files**  Always stores 64-bit programs. 
│    Will also store 16-bit and 32-bit programs for 
│    32-bit architecture OS.
│
└─── **\Program Files (x86)**  Stores 16-bit and 32-bit 
│    programs on 64-bit architecture OS.
│
└─── **\ProgramData**  A directory reserved for storing 
│    program data accessed by programs running on the 
│    computer. This director is hidden by default. 
│
└─── **\Windows**  The directory where the core OS files 
│   │          are installed.
│   │
│   └─── **\System32** This directory stores the 
│   │     dynamic-link library (DLL) files of 
│   │     32-bit or 64-bit Windows OS.
│   │
│   └─── **\Assembly** Assembly/DLL Directories
│
└─── **\System** This directory stores the dynamic-link 
│    library (DLL) files of 16-bit Windows OS.
│
└─── **\SysWOW64** This directory stores the dynamic-link 
│    library (DLL) files of 32-bit or 64-bit 
│    Windows OS.
│
└─── **\WinSxS** A directory that stores copies of all 
│    Windows components to include core kernel files, 
│    DLLs, service packs, etc.
│
└─── **\Temp** A temporary file directory.

### The Many Versions of Microsoft Windows

In total there are 40 versions of Windows, and that number grows. Most of the versions are no longer used, but you may encounter versions such as Windows XP and up in the wild. Most modern organizations will not allow the older versions of Windows in their network infrastructure because they are inherently insecure, so finding one may be a surprise. Each OS has an expected “End-of-Life” (EoL) before replacement by a newer version. Once the OS has reached its EoL, Microsoft will no longer develop patches or updates for that version of Windows, and will eventually end all support for the OS. For this reason, EoL Windows versions are guaranteed to be vulnerabilities on an organization’s computer infrastructure. The Windows versions that a Cybersecurity Analyst should be made aware of are:

Windows 7 - A highly adopted Windows desktop OS that reached EoL January 14, 2020.

Windows 8 - Not as popular as Windows 7, and reached EoL January 12, 2016.

Windows 10 - The latest highly deployed version of Windows. This is likely the version most encountered in the role of Cybersecurity Analyst. Windows 10 was the first version of the OS where Microsoft released many subversions of version 10. For example, every 4-6 months, Microsoft releases a new subversion of Windows 10 following the “Windows 10 version XXXX” format where “XXXX” represents the subversion number assigned.

Windows 11 - The newest version of Windows. This version is still in the earliest adoption phases, and is optional for PC users to upgrade to that version.

Each version of Windows comes in a few different versions. For example, Windows 10 comes in three different editions: Home, Pro, and Pro for Workstations. Each edition comes with added features, some which add more components to secure, or some that are added security features.

It’s important to know the versions of the OS on the infrastructure you are expected to secure. Each version of an OS comes with it’s own security features, vulnerabilities, and limitations.

### Windows Server

Microsoft develops another OS specifically designed for a system hosting centralized resources or computer services on a network. These types of OS are called servers. Windows Server, just like the Windows client OS, has a long list of versions and editions. The latest version is Windows Server 2022. Windows Server 2022 comes in three editions: Datacenter, Standard, and Essentials. Each edition offers features that are ideal for specific needs of an organization. Microsoft also offers a much lighter Server OS called Nano Server which reduces the OS to only essential/necessary components. For example, the Nano Server does not have a GUI desktop. Instead, it is maintained by command-line.

Microsoft will typically support a server version for an OS lifespan of about 10 years. It is good practice to build awareness of server versions, support lifespan, and edition features for any Windows Server encountered as a Cybersecurity Analyst.

Windows Server performs many important roles in modern enterprise networks.

Some common roles are:

-   Domain Controller - Service that performs the authentication and authorization of users to access network resources.
    
-   Active Directory - A directory service developed by Microsoft for Windows domains. This server stores and organizes information about all the users and resources.
    
-   Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) - Typically running on the domain controller, the DHCP is responsible for assigning network addresses to nodes on a domain.
    
-   Domain Name System (DNS) - The service responsible for operating and maintaining DNS. A reminder, DNS is the protocol considered the “phone book” of the internet. It translates human-friendly website addresses to numeric addresses understood by the computer.
    
-   File and Storage Services - Centralized file and storage services offered to a domain.
    
-   Hyper-V - Microsoft’s hypervisor technology. Hyper-V allows a server to host many virtual resources.
    
-   Print Services - A server that maintains and organizes networked printing services on a network.
    
-   Windows Update Services - This server stores all windows updates for the Microsoft software products used in an organization. It is centralized and accessible via the network to optimize patching by pushing updates to all Windows Server and Windows 7/8/10/11 client OS within the organization.
    

Windows Servers typically come with basic security settings set out of the box, but it is important to add additional hardening to each server on the network. Similar to the hardening steps provided in the Linux Security section of this article, these additional steps should be considered when installing a new Windows Server on a network:

-   Document Host Information: Any system joined to an enterprise network should be properly documented. Address information should be recorded, as well as other specific host information (hostname, hardware serials, etc.)
    
-   Secure the system’s Basic Input Output System (BIOS): The BIOS has access to system resources and configuration settings that may be used to alter the bootload method of an OS. This may be leveraged to compromise a system, therefore securing a BIOS, at a minimum, with a password is good practice.
    
-   Encrypt Storage: Encrypting the hard disks, whether encrypting individual files or applying full-disk encryption (FDE), is a good practice. This technique prevents unauthorized theft/access to the data on a systems storage device(s).
    
-   Disable unused hardware port(s): Data Loss Prevention (DLP) practices suggest that all unused hardware ports should be disabled (typically in the BIOS). The most important ports to disable are USB ports, since they may be leveraged to load malicious software and compromise a system.
    
-   Disable unused logical port(s): Disable any open connections unneeded on the system. Any open connection ports are an entry point to a computer system. Therefore, to reduce the compromise risk, close all unused connection ports.
    
-   Properly configure the user permissions: Securing the administrator user(s) and group(s) that have access to the server is critical. If an adversary gains administrator access to the server, it will gain full control.
    
-   Enforce strong password policies: Ensure the passwords stored on the system are not reused and that the password length and complexity minimum requirements are sufficient to prevent password attacks.
    
-   Patch, patch, patch: Maintain the system as up-to-date as possible. System and application patches contain vital security updates that help reduce system vulnerabilities and increase security.


# VMs, Cloud, & Mobile

A Cybersecurity Analyst is expected to effectively analyze the operating systems of an organization. In this article, we’ll discuss VMs, Cloud, and Mobile.

## Operating Systems & Virtualization

### Hypervisors

In virtualization technology, it is possible to install many OSs on a single computer device. For example, if sufficient computing resources (i.e. storage, memory, processing power, etc.) are installed on a single server, that server may host 5, 10, or 100+ (depending on the limitations of hardware and hypervisor) different OS using virtualization software called hypervisors. The tenant OSs share the hardware resources available to the virtual environment. A hypervisor abstracts hardware to software for tenant OS. This abstraction of hardware to software allows multiple OS to run on a single hardware device in virtualized environments. Tenant OS are installed in containers that are logically separated within the virtual environment. These OS containers, once fully installed and operational, are known as _virtual machines_ which we will discuss in the next section.

Many organizations operate on modernized infrastructure that use hypervisors and host virtual environments due to the many financial, operational, and technical benefits they offer. Though it is not defined as an OS, some hypervisors closely resemble an OS with a kernel and shell utilities (specifically the Linux kernel). It is an important topic to understand and be familiar with in the role of a cybersecurity analyst since hypervisors require hardening, patching, monitoring, and maintenance like all other systems on an organization’s infrastructure. For example, VMware’s ESXi bare metal hypervisor leverages the Linux kernel and may be maintained via a slightly modified shell:

```
    ESXi 6.7.0 http://www.vmware.com    Copyright (c) 2007-2019 VMware, Inc. codecademy-lab.localdomain login: rootPassword:The time and date of this login have been sent ot he system logs. WARNING:    All commands run on the ESXi shell are logged and may be included in    support bundles. Do not provide passwords directly on the CLI.    Most tools can prompt for secrets or accept them from standard input. VMware offers supported, powerful system administration tools. Pleasesee www.vmware.com/go/sysadmintools for details. The ESXi Shell can be disabled by an administrative user. See thevSphere Security documentation for more information.[root@codecademy-lab:~]
```

Types of Hypervisors:

_Type 1: Bare Metal_:

This means that the hypervisor is installed on the raw hardware resources of a computer. There is no software between the hardware and the hypervisor. It is installed directly on the hardware, therefore all available hardware is abstractly presented to the hypervisor’s virtual environment.

_Type 2: Hosted_:

A hosted hypervisor is installed on top of an existing OS of a computer. Unlike a bare-metal installation, the hosted hypervisor is installed similar to an application installed on an OS like Microsoft Windows or Apple macOS. Through the hosting OS, the available hardware is abstracted and presented to the virtual environment.

Common hypervisor products: Microsoft Hyper-V VMware ESXi VMware Workstation Virtual Box

### Virtual Machines (VM)

A Virtual Machine is a software computer that thinks it’s a physical computer. VMs run on virtualization technology which presents the physical hardware resources to the VM container as software. To an OS installed in a VM container the hardware presented by the hypervisor is tangible bare-metal hardware. What the OS doesn’t know is the hardware is actually advertised by VM modules as hardware.

This technology expands the capabilities of a single computer system since the total hardware resources of the system can be divided among many VMs. For example, a server with 4 Terabytes (TB) of storage may assign 1TB to two VMs and only 500 Gigabytes to two other VMs. Processing, memory, and network interfaces are other resources that may be shared amongst VMs on a host.

VMs are especially valuable in the modern computing infrastructure of today’s organizations. Since VMs are simply software, there are many benefits to using them. VMs improve costs, recovery, scalability, redundancy, deployment speeds, and much more. VMs act as regular computer systems and must be treated as such. Cybersecurity Analysts must be aware of the best practices of securing computer systems, and they must be familiar with the specific security recommendations for VMs.

### Cloud Consideration

Modern organizations are moving to the cloud. It is more common to see companies move their computer infrastructure to services like Microsoft Azure or Amazon Web Services (AWS). Cloud technology blends traditional data warehouse methods and heavily leverages virtualization technologies to build a plethora of resources and services that get leased out to customers. Yes,the cloud is simply a computer resource and/or service that is leased to the user. Things to consider: Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) VMs found here Hypervisors for On-Premise Systems Microsoft Azure Amazon Web Services (AWS) Software Defined Networking (SDN) A different approach to networking that leverages virtualization technology and cloud.

## Mobile OS

Now that we’ve covered the more familiar laptop, desktop, and server OS, let’s talk about the OS that we hold so closely to ourselves…mostly in our pockets. Mobile devices (i.e. smartphones, tablets, smart watches, etc.) are computers. Just like the larger computing devices we’ve discussed, they too require an OS.

The operating system of mobile devices typically follow the same OS architecture of traditional OS. The mobile OS will contain a kernel and a shell. Mobile devices have evolved to support the x86 and x64 processor architectures of regular computers, but on a much smaller mobile scale. The main hardware architecture platform for Android, for example, is the Advanced RISC Machine (ARM) processor architecture. ARM is a smaller CPU architecture that mobile devices use since they are small computer devices.

Android, for example, uses Linux as the kernel of the OS. In mobile computing, the OS typically contains a middleware layer(s) that lay the framework and runtimes necessary to leverage the Linux Kernel. Mobile app[lication]s are built on the framework established by the middleware layer(s).

Security practices implemented in traditional computer OS hardening will remain constant with mobile OS. Yet, it’s important to understand that the fundamental purpose of computers and mobile devices differ, therefore security approaches for mobile devices will require additional technique. Mobile devices are designed to be convenient, user-friendly, and equipped for not only functional productivity purposes (i.e. phone calls), but also heavily used for entertainment. All considerations to weigh as a security professional.

### Bring Your Own Device (BYOD)

BYOD is a practice of allowing employees of an organization to use their own computer devices in the workplace, and use them for official work purposes. These devices include laptops, desktop workstations, smartphones, tablets, and even smartwatches. What does this mean to the Cybersecurity Analyst?

Understanding the mobile OS capabilities and the methods of properly securing mobile devices through organization policy is a function of the analyst. BYOD practices add complexity to securing an organization. Since employees utilize their personal devices for work, the way information is secured will require different approaches. Some of the mobile device techniques applied in the BYOD are storage compartmentalization, security policy enforcement, and encryption.

Devices joined to an organization’s networks must be scanned for malware and prove the installed OS remains uncompromised. For example, some smartphone users like to break through default security applied to mobile phone OS for the purpose of installing unauthorized apps and applying OS tweaks. In iPhones, this is called jailbreaking. For Androids, it’s called rooting. When a smartphone is rooted or jailbroken, the smartphone owner gains administrator/root access. Therefore, they gain permission in the mobile OS to do almost anything they want. This practice is very insecure since any unauthorized apps installed also gain administrator/root access to the mobile OS and are exposed to many vulnerabilities. A device that is jailbroken/rooted should not be joined to an organization’s networks because they introduce unwanted vulnerabilities.



# Important PowerShell Commands for Cybersecurity Analysts

The basics of PowerShell commands useful for any Cybersecurity professional.

## What You’ll Be Learning

**PowerShell** is a command-line interface and scripting language for task automation and configuration management. In this article, you will learn the basics of PowerShell along with the commands useful for any [Cybersecurity](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/cybersecurity) professional.

## Basic PowerShell commands and uses

Let’s begin by reviewing some fundamental PowerShell commands and use cases. These commands are the building blocks to create scripts that will help automate and review security-related tasks.

[(back to table of contents)](https://www.codecademy.com/paths/cybersecurity-analyst-interview-prep/tracks/practice-scripting-challenges-for-cybersecurity-analysts/modules/powershell-scripting-challenges/articles/important-powershell-commands-for-cybersecurity-analysts#heading-table-of-contents)

### `Get-Help`

To get help or more details for the particular command, you can use the **`Get-Help`** cmdlet with the command that you need help with. For example, if we run the following:

```
Get- Help Get-Process
```

We will get additional help on a specific command.

You can view a list of all available help topics by typing `Get-Help`.

[(back to top of section)](https://www.codecademy.com/paths/cybersecurity-analyst-interview-prep/tracks/practice-scripting-challenges-for-cybersecurity-analysts/modules/powershell-scripting-challenges/articles/important-powershell-commands-for-cybersecurity-analysts#heading-basic-powershell-commands-and-uses)

### Cmdlets

We just mentioned **cmdlets**, but what are they? cmdlets are small, lightweight PowerShell modules designed to run tasks in place of traditional commands. Cmdlets will return an output as an object (or an array of objects) which also allows you to transfer this data to other cmdlets using pipes.

Cmdlets always contain a verb and a noun separated by a dash. (For Example: `Get-DnsServer` or `Remove-ADGroup`.

Examples of verbs you might see are:

**Get**: get something **Set**: define something **Start**: run something **Stop**: stop something **New**: create something

[(back to top of section)](https://www.codecademy.com/paths/cybersecurity-analyst-interview-prep/tracks/practice-scripting-challenges-for-cybersecurity-analysts/modules/powershell-scripting-challenges/articles/important-powershell-commands-for-cybersecurity-analysts#heading-basic-powershell-commands-and-uses)

### Pipe

A pipe character `|` is used to pass data from one cmdlet to another. For example, pipes can be used to sort the output of one cmdlet and redirect that output to a file. Multiple pipes can be used in tandem to build more complex actions!

For example, to create a list of running processes on your machine, and save it to a file, we would use the command below:

```
Get-Process | Out-File c:\PS\powershell.txt
```

Learn more in the [Out-File docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.utility/out-file?view=powershell-7.2).

### Using PowerShell to traverse directories

Commands for changing directories and viewing directory listings are the same as the Linux command line and Windows command prompt. Commands such as `cd`, `dir`, `mkdir`,`ls`, `type`, etc will still work.

[Learn more in the Managing Current Location docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/samples/managing-current-location?view=powershell-7.2).

### Aliases

Aliases in PowerShell provide an alternative name for running a cmdlet. There are several shorthand aliases built-in. For example, the `ls` command will generate the same results as `Get-ChildItem`.

```
PS C\User\U1D256> ls      Directory: C\User\U1D256> Mode                 LastWriteTime        Length Name----                 -------------        ------ ----d-----           11/5/2021 10:37AM               .vscoded-r---           11/16/2021 8:00AM               .Documentsd-r---          12/17/2021 10:02AM               .Downloads PS C\User\U1D256> Get-ChildItem      Directory: C\User\U1D256> Mode                 LastWriteTime        Length Name----                 -------------        ------ ----d-----           11/5/2021 10:37AM               .vscoded-r---           11/16/2021 8:00AM               .Documentsd-r---          12/17/2021 10:02AM               .Downloads
```

All aliases can be viewed by running the `alias` command, and specific aliases can be viewed by specifying them; for example, `alias cd`. In the screenshot below we see that the alias for **cd** is **Set-Location**.

```
PS C\User\U1D256> alias cd Command Type      Name                 Version      Source    ------------      ----                 -------      ------Alias             cd -> Set-Location
```

## Files in PowerShell

In this section, we will learn how to:

-   Read a file using the `Get-Content`.
-   Create a new file using the `Set-Content` command.

[(back to table of contents)](https://www.codecademy.com/paths/cybersecurity-analyst-interview-prep/tracks/practice-scripting-challenges-for-cybersecurity-analysts/modules/powershell-scripting-challenges/articles/important-powershell-commands-for-cybersecurity-analysts#heading-table-of-contents)

### Reading from a file

Similar to the `cat` command in Linux, we can use the `Get-Content` cmdlet in PowerShell to read the contents of a file. When `Get-Content` is run, the contents of the file are read and the result can be stored in a variable for later use or displayed on the screen.

For example, we can use the command `Get-Content /PS/Names.txt` to read the file `Names` which is saved on a local `C Drive` in a folder named `PS`.

```
PS C:\> Get-Content /PS/Names.txtLiam JohnsonOlivia PopeNoah ClarkEmma MichaelsonOliver WashingtonAva MillerElijah WilliamsCharlotte SmithMohammed WhiteJaris Rodriguez
```

> **Note:** By adding the `-TotalCount` argument, we can specify how many lines we would like PowerShell to read from the top.

```
 Get-Content <PATH> -TotalCount 5
```

Adding `-TotalCount 5` shows the top five items in the `names.txt` file.

```
PS C:\> Get-Content -TotalCount 5 /PS/Names.txtLiam JohnsonOlivia PopeNoah ClarkEmma MichaelsonOliver Washington
```

The `-Tail` argument will do the same but read from the bottom of the file.

[(back to top of section)](https://www.codecademy.com/paths/cybersecurity-analyst-interview-prep/tracks/practice-scripting-challenges-for-cybersecurity-analysts/modules/powershell-scripting-challenges/articles/important-powershell-commands-for-cybersecurity-analysts#heading-files-in-powershell)

### Writing content to a file

In addition to reading files, it is possible to write data to files, either by using the `Set-Content` command to create and overwrite files or the `Add-Content` command to append content to an existing file.

```
PS C:\> Set-Content - Value "Rachel Rose" -Path /PS/Names.txtPS C:\> Get-Content /PS/Names.txtRachel RosePS C:\>
```

### `Convert-To`

Structured data types can be converted into different formats using PowerShell cmdlets; for example, from `.txt` to [`.csv`](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/general/csv). Some common ConvertTo commands in PowerShell are:

-   `ConvertTo-Csv`
-   `ConvertTo-Html`
-   `ConvertTo-Json`
-   `ConvertTo-Xml`

Here are some [additional Reading on Convert commands](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.utility/convertto-csv?view=powershell-7.2)

### `Convert-From`

Alternatively, the `Convert-From` command creates objects from different formats using variable-length strings that are generated by the `ConvertTo` cmdlets. Some common `Convert-From` commands in PowerShell are:

-   `ConvertFrom-Csv`
-   `ConvertFrom-Json`
-   `ConvertFrom-Markdown`
-   `ConvertFrom-StringData

For example, the `ConvertTo-Json` cmdlet allows you to convert an object into a JSON-formatted string. The properties are converted to field names, the field values are converted to property values, and the methods are removed.

```

### Creating files and folders

We create items in PowerShell using the `New-Item` command.

**Example:** This command creates the new folder `C:\temp\Test Folder`

```
New-Item -Path 'C:\temp\Test Folder' -ItemType Directory
```

**Example:** This command creates the new empty file **C:\temp\New Folder\file.txt**

```
New-Item -Path 'C:\temp\Test Folder\file.txt' -ItemType File
```

## Commands to import and remove modules in PowerShell

In this section, you will learn how to use PowerShell Modules. Modules provide the capability to group like functions together. There are a number of built-in modules and additional modules can be installed or will appear on top of other modules.

In PowerShell, a module is considered a package that contains various functions, workflows, and variables that can operate as a small program.

For additional information, check out the [Microsoft Documentation on modules](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.core/about/about_modules?view=powershell-7.2&viewFallbackFrom=powershell-6).

### PowerShell Gallery

The PowerShell Gallery is a repository for sharing useful PowerShell scripts and modules, some items are created by Microsoft and some are created by the PowerShell community.

[Browse the PowerShell Gallery for modules you’ll want to install here](https://www.powershellgallery.com/).

### Viewing modules

Using the `Get-Module` cmdlet will list currently loaded modules on a computer. Using the `-ListAvailable` option with this command will also allow you to view all modules that are available for use but not yet imported on the computer.

The `-ListAvailable` option can also be used when a specific module has been provided to list all the available functions for that module.

[(back to top of section)](https://www.codecademy.com/paths/cybersecurity-analyst-interview-prep/tracks/practice-scripting-challenges-for-cybersecurity-analysts/modules/powershell-scripting-challenges/articles/important-powershell-commands-for-cybersecurity-analysts#heading-commands-to-import-and-remove-modules-in-powershell)

### Importing modules

Modules need to be imported to your local PowerShell session before the cmdlets and functions from that module can be used. Modules can be loaded into the current PowerShell session by using the `Import-Module` cmdlet and specifying the module either by name `(-Name)` or by path `(-Path)`.

**Example**: If you needed to import the PKI PowerShell module, which is used in digital certificates to protect sensitive public key infrastructure data, you would use this comment:

```
Import-Module -Name PKI
```

### Installing modules

If a module is not listed as available, then the module can be installed from a repository, such as the [PowerShell Gallery](https://www.powershellgallery.com/), or from another repository using the `-InstallModule` cmdlet.

[(back to top of section)](https://www.codecademy.com/paths/cybersecurity-analyst-interview-prep/tracks/practice-scripting-challenges-for-cybersecurity-analysts/modules/powershell-scripting-challenges/articles/important-powershell-commands-for-cybersecurity-analysts#heading-commands-to-import-and-remove-modules-in-powershell)

### Removing modules

When you need to remove a module, the commands that the module added are deleted from the session. This is useful when creating your own modules as you may need to remove and re-import a module when you make changes to it.

**Example**: We would remove the PKI module using the command:

```
Remove-Module -Name PKI
```

## Commands for daily security tasks

In this section, you will learn some of the most common PowerShell security commands that are used by every Cybersecurity professional today. You should be familiar with these common commands used for troubleshooting well-known [cyberattacks](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/cybersecurity/cyber-attack) in the industry today.

[(back to table of contents)](https://www.codecademy.com/paths/cybersecurity-analyst-interview-prep/tracks/practice-scripting-challenges-for-cybersecurity-analysts/modules/powershell-scripting-challenges/articles/important-powershell-commands-for-cybersecurity-analysts#heading-table-of-contents)

### `Get-ExecutionPolicy` and `Set-ExecutionPolicy`

You can create and execute PowerShell scripts, however, Microsoft has disabled scripting by default in an effort to prevent malicious code from executing in a PowerShell environment. You can use the `Get-ExecutionPolicy` to check which execution policy is enforced prior to running a script and then use the `Set-ExecutionPolicy` command to change the level of security if needed.

There are four levels of security associated with the `Set-ExecutionPolicy` command:

-   **Unrestricted**: This removes all restrictions from the execution policy.
-   **Restricted**: This is the default execution policy and only allows commands to be entered interactively. PowerShell scripts are not allowed to run.
-   **All Signed**: If the execution policy is set to `All Signed`, scripts will be allowed to run if they are signed by a trusted publisher.
-   **Remote Signed**: If the execution policy is set to `Remote Signed`, PowerShell scripts that have been created locally will be allowed to run. Scripts created remotely will be allowed to run if they are signed by a trusted publisher.

### `Get-Service`

This command provides a list of every service that is currently installed on your system.

If you suspect a particular service is worth checking out for security reasons, we can append the `–Name` argument, and this will allow you to see the state of the service on the machine.

```
PS C:\Users\U1D256> Get-Service Status  Name            Display Name------  ----            ------------Running BFE             Base Filtering SystemStopped BITS            Background Intelligent Transfer Ser...Running camsvc          Capability Access Manager Service...
```

[(back to top of section)](https://www.codecademy.com/paths/cybersecurity-analyst-interview-prep/tracks/practice-scripting-challenges-for-cybersecurity-analysts/modules/powershell-scripting-challenges/articles/important-powershell-commands-for-cybersecurity-analysts#heading-commands-for-daily-security-tasks)

### `Get-Process`

Unlike the `Get-Service` command in PowerShell, which displays a list of the different system services, the `Get-Process` command can display a list of every process the system currently runs. This command can also be used to query processes running on a remote machine or [server](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/general/server).

```
PS C:\Users\U1D256> Get-Process Handles  NPM(K)   PM(K)    WS(K)    CPU(s)     Id SI ProcessName-------  ------   -----    -----    ------     -- -- -----------   3071     138  359840   354688            25248  0 A180AG   1001      52  52820     65824  1,557.13   8732  1 A180RS...
```

### `Stop-Process`

This is the complementary command to `Get-Process`. If you suspect that a malicious or unwanted process is running on your local machine or remote server, running `Stop-Process -Name` or `Stop-Process -Id` will terminate the running process.

For example, if you wanted to find the owner of a running process on a machine, try this script:

```
PS C:\Users\U1D256> Get-Process pwsh -IncludeUserName Handles      WS(K)   CPU(s)     Id UserName            ProcessName-------      -----   ------     -- --------            -----------    782     132080     2.08   2188 DOMAIN01\user01     pwsh
```

### `Get-EventLog`

Being able to read logs from the local machine is important. Event logs are an important part of fault diagnosis or incident response.

PowerShell can be used to parse your computer’s event logs using the `Get-EventLog` command. By default, it will query the local machine; however, it can also be used to query logs from remote connections.

For additional reading, check out the [Microsoft document on Get-EventLog](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.management/get-eventlog?view=powershell-5.1).

[(back to top of section)](https://www.codecademy.com/paths/cybersecurity-analyst-interview-prep/tracks/practice-scripting-challenges-for-cybersecurity-analysts/modules/powershell-scripting-challenges/articles/important-powershell-commands-for-cybersecurity-analysts#heading-commands-for-daily-security-tasks)

### `Get-ADUser`

The **Get-ADUser** cmdlet gets a specified user object or performs a search to get multiple user objects. This cmdlet retrieves a default set of user object properties. To retrieve additional properties use the `-Properties` parameter.

Security teams such as Identity Access Management Teams and Identity Governance Teams heavily leverage this command.

**Example**: This command gets all of the properties of the user with the SAM account name Nicole Scott.

```
PS C:\Users\U1D256>Get-ADUser -Identity NicoleScott -Properties * Surname           : ScottName              : Nicole ScottUserPrincipalName :GivenName         : NicoleEnabled           : FalseSamAccountName    : NicoleScottObjectClass       : userSID               : S-1-5-21-2889043008-4136710315-2444824263-3544ObjectGUID        : e1418d64-096c-4cb0-b903-ebb66562d99dDistinguishedName : CN=Nicole Scott,OU=NorthAmerica,OU=Sales,OU=UserAccounts,DC=FABRIKAM,DC=COM
```

### DNS lookups

[DNS](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/general/dns) attacks remain one of the top attacks that Cybersecurity professionals will have to troubleshoot today. The DNS service is a well known attack vector for hackers today.

We can look up the DNS entry for a host using the command:

```
Resolve-DnsName -Name "Hostname"
```

By appending the `-server` switch, followed by a DNS server’s IP address, we can perform a DNS resolve request against a specific server to verify resolution is working properly.

The `Get-DnsClient` cmdlet lets you check the DNS client information for a device. It indicates what DNS servers are being used by the device to perform address resolutions as configured on multiple adapters.

The `Set-DnsClientServerAddress` cmdlet allows for specified DNS servers to be added to the network configuration.

Here are some [additional DNS PowerShell Commands](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/dnsserver/?view=windowsserver2022-ps)

[(back to top of section)](https://www.codecademy.com/paths/cybersecurity-analyst-interview-prep/tracks/practice-scripting-challenges-for-cybersecurity-analysts/modules/powershell-scripting-challenges/articles/important-powershell-commands-for-cybersecurity-analysts#heading-commands-for-daily-security-tasks)

### Ping devices locally or remotely

The `Test-NetConnection` cmdlet allows us to test network connectivity on the LAN and WAN.

For example, the command `Test-NetConnection -ComputerName "Hostname or IP"` performs a ping which determines if network connectivity between the local device and the target computer or domain exists.

This is a useful command for a security professional executing a DDoS attack.

### `Get-NetIPConfiguration`

The `Get-NetIPConfiguration` cmdlet gets network configurations, including usable interfaces, IP addresses, and DNS servers. This is helpful for any cybersecurity professional who needs to troubleshoot and identify any rogue IP addresses on the network.

[(back to top of section)](https://www.codecademy.com/paths/cybersecurity-analyst-interview-prep/tracks/practice-scripting-challenges-for-cybersecurity-analysts/modules/powershell-scripting-challenges/articles/important-powershell-commands-for-cybersecurity-analysts#heading-commands-for-daily-security-tasks)

### Testing network connection

The `Test-NetConnection` cmdlet shows diagnostic information for a connection. It supports ping tests, TCP tests, route tracing, and route selection diagnostics. Depending on the parameters, the output can include the DNS lookup results, a list of IP interfaces, IPsec rules, route/source address selection results, and/or confirmation of connection establishment.

Port security attacks are very prevalent today. If we want to verify if a port is open on our machine or server we could run this command:

```
Test-NetConnection -ComputerName 127.0.0.1 -Port 4000
```

## Remote PowerShell commands

Windows PowerShell remoting lets you run any Windows PowerShell command on one or more remote computers. You can establish persistent connections, start interactive sessions, and run scripts on remote computers. The remote computer must be configured for remote management.

Read more about remove PowerShell commands [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.core/about/about_remote_requirements?view=powershell-7.2).

### Start a session

To start an interactive session with a single remote computer, use the Enter-PSSession cmdlet. For example, to start an interactive session with the Server01 remote computer, use the following command:

```
Enter-PSSession Server01
```

To end the interactive session, use the following command:

```
Exit-PSSession
```

### Run a script

To run a script on remote computers, use the `-FilePath` parameter from the `Invoke-Command` cmdlet. The script must be accessible by your local computer. The results are returned to your local computer.

**Example**: The following command runs the `GetActiveAccounts.ps1` script on the remote computers, Server11, and Server12.

```
Invoke-Command -ComputerName Server11, Server12 -FilePath c:\Scripts\GetActiveAccounts.ps1
```
